In Saccharomyces cerevisiae , vesicles that carry proteins from the ER to the Golgi compartment are encapsulated by COPII coat proteins . We identified mutations in ten genes , designated LST ( lethal with sec-thirteen ) , that were lethal in combination with the COPII mutation GENE1 - 1 . GENE2 showed synthetic-lethal interactions with the complete set of COPII genes , indicating that GENE2 encodes a new COPII function . GENE2 codes for a protein similar in sequence to the COPII subunit Sec24p . Like Sec24p , Lst1p is a peripheral ER membrane protein that binds to the COPII subunit Sec23p . Chromosomal deletion of GENE2 is not lethal , but inhibits transport of the plasma membrane proton-ATPase ( Pma1p ) to the cell surface , causing poor growth on media of low pH. Localization by both immunofluorescence microscopy and cell fractionation shows that the export of Pma1p from the ER is impaired in lst1Delta mutants . Transport of other proteins from the ER was not affected by lst1Delta , nor was Pma1p transport found to be particularly sensitive to other COPII defects . Together , these findings suggest that a specialized form of the COPII coat subunit , with Lst1p in place of Sec24p , is used for the efficient packaging of Pma1p into vesicles derived from the ER .
To perform further genetic tests on the lst mutations , the lst OTHER_GENE - 1 double mutants were converted to lst single mutants by integration of a wild-type copy of SEC13 at the OTHER_GENE - 1 locus ( Materials and Methods ) . Representative lst single mutants were then crossed to OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , and GENE1 mutants . For mutations in LST2 , LST3 , OTHER_GENE , LST5 , OTHER_GENE , and OTHER_GENE , only crosses to OTHER_GENE - 1 gave a segregation pattern indicative of a synthetic-lethal interaction ( Table III ) . We have subsequently shown that these LST genes relate to a function of SEC13 in the sorting of amino acid permeases in the late secretory pathway , and analysis of these genes is described elsewhere ( Roberg et al. , 1997a , b ) . Mutations in GENE2 were inviable when combined with OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , and GENE1 mutations , and mutations in LST6 were inviable with OTHER_GENE and GENE1 ( Table III ) . Importantly , mutations in GENE2 and LST6 did not show synthetic lethality in parallel crosses to mutations in SEC17 or SEC18 , genes required for fusion of COPII vesicles . Given that synthetic-lethal interactions usually occur between mutations in genes involved in the same step of the secretory pathway , the tests for genetic interactions indicated that GENE2 , and probably also LST6 , participate in vesicle budding from the ER .

We have subsequently shown that these LST genes relate to a function of SEC13 in the sorting of amino acid permeases in the late secretory pathway , and analysis of these genes is described elsewhere ( Roberg et al. , 1997a , b ) . Mutations in OTHER_GENE were inviable when combined with GENE1 , OTHER_GENE , and OTHER_GENE mutations , and mutations in LST6 were inviable with GENE1 and OTHER_GENE ( Table III ) . Importantly , mutations in OTHER_GENE and LST6 did not show synthetic lethality in parallel crosses to mutations in SEC17 or SEC18 , genes required for fusion of COPII vesicles . Given that synthetic-lethal interactions usually occur between mutations in genes involved in the same step of the secretory pathway , the tests for genetic interactions indicated that OTHER_GENE , and probably also LST6 , participate in vesicle budding from the ER .
To perform further genetic tests on the lst mutations , the lst OTHER_GENE - 1 double mutants were converted to lst single mutants by integration of a wild-type copy of SEC13 at the OTHER_GENE - 1 locus ( Materials and Methods ) .

One copy of the LST1 gene in the wild-type diploid strain CKY348 was disrupted to generate a lst1Delta::LEU2/LST1 heterozygote . Sporulation and dissection of this diploid gave > 95 % spore viability on YPD medium and the LEU2 marker segregated 2:2 , showing that LST1 is not essential for growth . A lst1Delta::LEU2 mutant spore clone was crossed to sec mutants to test for synthetic lethality . In these crosses , both the temperature sensitivity of the sec mutation and the OTHER_GENE allele marked by LEU2 could be followed independently . In crosses of OTHER_GENE to OTHER_GENE , GENE1 , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , or GENE2 mutants , inviability segregated as a two-gene trait ( segregation patterns for dead : viable spore clones were 2:2 , 1:3 , and 0:4 ) . Tests of the genotype of the surviving sister spore clones showed that the inviable spores in these crosses were always OTHER_GENE sec double mutants . Crosses between OTHER_GENE and sec17 or sec18 produced viable double mutants . These findings confirmed and extended our earlier tests for synthetic lethality with lst1 - 1 , and demonstrated that OTHER_GENE was synthetically lethal with all the known genes required for COPII vesicle formation , but not with genes required for vesicle fusion .

Having identified conditions where LST1 was needed for growth , we investigated whether overexpression of OTHER_GENE could supply the function lost in GENE1 . Some restoration of function was indicated by the ability of an GENE1 mutant to grow on acidic medium when provided with extra copies of OTHER_GENE on either centromeric or 2mu plasmids ( Fig. 3 B ) . These findings imply some functional overlap between LST1 and OTHER_GENE . In parallel tests for suppression , we found that the genes SEC12 , SEC13 , SEC31 , or SEC23 , when expressed from 2mu plasmids , could not restore the ability of an GENE1 mutant to grow on acidic medium . We found that the GENE1 mutation caused a selective defect in the trafficking of GENE2 from the ER , and we also examined the ability of overexpressed OTHER_GENE to suppress this phenotype caused by the GENE1 mutation . By immunofluorescence microscopy , the proper localization of GENE2 to the cell surface was restored in an GENE1 strain that also carried OTHER_GENE on a 2mu plasmid ( see Fig. 5 ) .

By immunofluorescence microscopy , the proper localization of GENE2 to the cell surface was restored in an OTHER_GENE strain that also carried GENE1 on a 2mu plasmid ( see Fig. 5 ) .
Having identified conditions where LST1 was needed for growth , we investigated whether overexpression of GENE1 could supply the function lost in GENE2 . Some restoration of function was indicated by the ability of an GENE2 mutant to grow on acidic medium when provided with extra copies of GENE1 on either centromeric or 2mu plasmids ( Fig. 3 B ) . These findings imply some functional overlap between LST1 and GENE1 . In parallel tests for suppression , we found that the genes SEC12 , SEC13 , SEC31 , or SEC23 , when expressed from 2mu plasmids , could not restore the ability of an GENE2 mutant to grow on acidic medium . We found that the GENE2 mutation caused a selective defect in the trafficking of OTHER_GENE from the ER , and we also examined the ability of overexpressed GENE1 to suppress this phenotype caused by the GENE2 mutation . By immunofluorescence microscopy , the proper localization of OTHER_GENE to the cell surface was restored in an GENE2 strain that also carried GENE1 on a 2mu plasmid ( see Fig. 5 ) .
In an attempt to test the effect of overexpression of GENE1 , we found that GENE1 on a 2mu plasmid severely impaired growth of wild-type yeast cells . To examine the response of cells to different doses of Lst1p , we designed a way to express different levels of Lst1p according to the amount of galactose in the growth medium . A wild-type strain ( CKY473 ) carrying a plasmid that expressed GENE1 from pGAL1 ( pKR35 ) was spread on an SMM plate with 2 % raffinose , a carbon source that allows yeast growth without repression of the GAL1 promoter . When these cells are exposed to a gradient of galactose concentrations , from 3 mg of galactose in a filter disk on top of the lawn , growth was inhibited in a halo 1.5 cm beyond the edge of the filter ( Fig. 3 C ) . A strain that did not contain pKR35 grew uniformly up to the edge of the filter , showing that the galactose itself was not inhibitory . Given the similarity of Lst1p to Sec24p , we asked whether the overexpression of GENE2 could compensate for overexpression of GENE1 . Cells carrying both the pGAL1-LST1 plasmid ( pKR35 ) and the GENE2 gene on a 2mu plasmid ( pKR41 ) were tested in an identical halo assay , and were found to be resistant to the effect of galactose ( Fig. 3 C ) . Suppression by GENE2 appeared to be specific , since parallel tests of 2mu plasmids carrying SEC12 , SEC13 , SEC31 , or SEC23 failed to show suppression . It is worth noting that SEC23 expressed from a 2mu plasmid significantly slows the growth of our yeast strains . Any suppression afforded by overexpression of SEC23 might be counteracted by this inherent toxicity of SEC23 . A simple conclusion that can be drawn from these overexpression studies is that too great of a stoichiometric excess of Lst1p over Sec24p is lethal . This observation can be explained if Lst1p and Sec24p compete with one another in the assembly of vesicle coat complexes and that excess Lst1p causes sequestration of vesicle components into complexes that fail to satisfy some essential function of COPII .

Cotransfection of GENE1 and GENE2 induced even higher apoptosis . To convey more clearly the high levels of apoptosis that resulted from overexpressing these two proteins , example images captured at low magnification are provided . Fig. 8 C shows that at 16 h after cotransfection almost 13 % of PS2-expressing cells ( which presumably also expressed GENE2 since GENE1 and GENE2 staining showed a near 1:1 correspondence [ data not shown ] ) on coverslips were positive for CytoDEATH staining . By 40 h the proportion of apoptotic cells had increased to ~50 % of the PS2-stained cells . The high level of apoptosis seen on coverslips was striking , especially since this method only captured a brief " window " of the cells progression into apoptosis as during programmed cell death HeLa cells lose their adherence on coverslips and float away into the media . This phenomenon explains the reduction in total cells , and most notably PS-expressing cells ( only 10 cells ) , remaining on the coverslip at 40 h after cotransfection ( Fig. 8 D ) . In the examples shown in Fig. 8 only a subset of PS overexpressing cells were apoptotic , indicating a time-dependent process , whereas the corollary that all apoptotic cells were also overexpressors always held true . In contrast when a control protein , the neurofilament light ( NF-L ) subunit , was overexpressed in HeLa cells ( Fig. 8 E ) , minimal apoptosis ( < 1 % ) was detected and total cell counts and expression levels remained high even at 40 h. It is remarkable that the single apoptotic cell in this field did not stain for NF-L and that , conversely , there are several rounded-up and highly expressing cells ( presumably those in mitosis ) , none of which appeared apoptotic . Fields of cells overexpressing GENE2 or GENE1 individually showed levels of apoptosis above the neurofilament background , but less than coexpressors . Unfortunately , due to variation between ( and even within ) coverslips , this method did not prove suitable for statistically significant quantification .
Because CytoDEATH labeling on coverslips only captured a narrow " window " of cells undergoing apoptosis , we decided to quantify the total amount of cell death accumulated over time by counting the total number of floating cells in the media after transfection with various amounts of plasmid DNAs encoding GENE1 and GENE2 . This simple method was more reliable in quantifying cell death . As graphed in Fig. 9 , transient overexpression of GENE2 increased cell death in a dose-dependent manner , whereas cell death induced by GENE1 overexpression reached a plateau at 10 mug of transfected DNA . More interestingly , when both proteins were coexpressed in the linear cell death range of their respective DNAs , cell death increased 5.9-fold over the control , compared with 2.7- and 2.4-fold for the same respective transfection amounts of GENE1 and GENE2 individually , suggesting that these two proteins have additive effects in promoting cell death . When these floating cells were collected and stained with the CytoDEATH antibody , ~85 % of the cells stained positive for this marker of apoptosis , bolstering our belief that counting floating cells is a reliable measure of cell death .

The finding that OTHER_GENE and GENE1 can function as cofactors for the Rev export pathway prompted us to investigate whether they also synergize with GENE2 and OTHER_GENE . We cotransfected , together with Rev and the reporter pDM128 , various combinations of the four molecules ( Fig. 2 ) . The transfected cells expressed three- to fivefold higher levels of these proteins than mock-transfected cells ( Fig. 2 A ) . A synergistic effect of coexpressing OTHER_GENE or GENE1 with either GENE2 or OTHER_GENE , was readily observable ( Fig. 2 B ) . Whereas transfection of the individual plasmids ( OTHER_GENE , GENE1 , GENE2 , and OTHER_GENE ) brought about an ~1.5-fold increase in CAT activity , compared with Rev alone , various combinations ( Eps15/Hrb , Eps15/Hrbl , Eps15R/Hrb , and Eps15R/Hrbl ) caused an ~3.0 - 3.5-fold increase . Maximal activation was thus significantly superior to the sum of the individual effects , suggesting that OTHER_GENE ( or GENE1 ) and GENE2 ( or OTHER_GENE ) can synergistically activate the Rev export pathway .

GENE1 synergizes with GENE2 , not with Smad6 , in inhibiting TGF-beta-induced transcription .
The induction of extracellular matrix protein genes is one of the best-characterized responses to TGF-beta ( 31 ) . This response can be used to evaluate the involvement of a gene in TGF-beta signal transduction using transient transfection assays . Transcription of a luciferase reporter containing a PAI-I promoter fragment is frequently used to measure the induction of extracellular matrix protein synthesis in response to TGF-beta ( 31 ) . We tested the potential role of GENE1 in Smad7-mediated inhibition of transcriptional responses in Mv1Lu and HepG2 cells , which are highly TGF-beta responsive . Initially , we focused our analyses on a TGF-beta-responsive reporter , p3TP-Lux ( 49 ) , which contains elements from the PAI-1 promoter and which drives expression of a luciferase reporter gene . Transient transfection of p3TP-Lux into Mv1Lu cells resulted in low basal levels of transcription , which was strongly induced in response to TGF-beta signaling . Overexpression of GENE1 suppressed the TGF-beta-induced increase in luciferase activity moderately in a dose-dependent manner . GENE2 showed appreciable inhibition of TGF-beta-induced transcription as expected ( 21 , 47 ) . Coexpression of GENE2 and GENE1 synergistically inhibited the p3TP promoter activity in response to TGF-beta ( Fig. 1A ) . In contrast , only a slight inhibition was observed in the absence of TGF-beta signaling . To examine whether this synergy in inhibiting TGF-beta signals was specific , we used a mutant of GENE2 , Smad7-Delta408 , in our experiments . This mutant can not bind the receptor complex and has little effect in blocking TGF-beta signals ( 21 , 47 ) . Consistent with these observations , Smad7-Delta408 had little effect on the p3TP promoter activity , either in the absence or presence of GENE1 , in response to TGF-beta . Importantly , GENE1 did not show any synergy with Smad6 ( an antagonist of BMP signaling ) in suppressing TGF-beta-induced transcription ( Fig. 1B ) . We constructed a mutant of GENE1 , STRAP(1 - 294 ) , by deleting the C-terminal 57 amino acids and keeping all WD40 domains intact . This mutant was not phosphorylated in vivo , whereas GENE1 was phosphorylated through its C terminus . STRAP(1 - 294 ) showed the same inhibitory effect as wild-type GENE1 , either in the absence or presence of GENE2 ( Fig. 1B ) , suggesting that phosphorylation of GENE1 is dispensable for this transcriptional response .
To further examine the synergistic inhibition by GENE1 and GENE2 , we used another TGF-beta-responsive reporter (CAGA)9MLP-Luc , which contains multiple copies of a Smad3- and Smad4-binding CAGA box element upstream of a minimal adenovirus major-late promoter ( 14 ) . This reporter was induced by 150-fold in response to TGF-beta signaling . GENE1 alone had little effect on (CAGA)9MLP-Luc promoter activity ( Fig. 2A ) . GENE2 alone showed 57-fold repression of the promoter activity , but in the presence of GENE1 it showed dose-dependent repression , reaching a maximum of 105-fold repression , in the presence of TGF-beta signaling ( Fig. 2A ) . However , in cells expressing GENE1 and Smad7-Delta408 , there was no synergy in the inhibition of TGF-beta-mediated transcriptional activation of the promoter activity . The phosphorylation-incompetent mutant of GENE1 showed synergy with GENE2 , similar to wild-type GENE1 . These data suggest that GENE1 synergistically inhibits TGF-beta signaling with GENE2 but not with the GENE2 mutant or Smad6 .
To investigate whether GENE1 has a similar effect on a natural promoter , we performed transient transfection assays with a reporter plasmid ( pGLuc 884 ) ( 9 ) containing the luciferase gene under the control of the TGF-beta-inducible PAI-1 gene promoter . This reporter was strongly induced in HepG2 cells in response to TGF-beta signaling initiated either by treatment of the cells with 100 pM TGF-beta ( Fig. 2C , left ) or by coexpression with a constitutively active version of TGF-beta type I receptor , TbetaR-I(TD ) ( right ) . We observed a weak suppression of TGF-beta-dependent induction of the PAI-1 promoter by GENE1 . GENE1 showed a synergy in the inhibition of the PAI-1 promoter with wild-type GENE2 but not with the mutant Smad7-Delta408 ( Fig. 2C ) . Taken together , these results show a functional synergy between GENE1 and GENE2 in the negative regulation of transcription mediated by TGF-beta , and a mutant of GENE2 that fails to associate with the receptor does not synergize with GENE1 .
Since OTHER_GENE and GENE1 are centrally involved in mediating TGF-beta signals , we examined whether OTHER_GENE or GENE1 might affect the synergistic inhibition of TGF-beta-induced transcription by GENE2 and OTHER_GENE . As shown in Fig. 7A , cotransfection of GENE2 and OTHER_GENE in HepG2 cells strongly repressed the p3TP promoter activity . This inhibition of the TGF-beta-dependent activation of the promoter was reversed by GENE1 in a dose-dependent manner ( maximum induction , 125-fold ) . The expression of OTHER_GENE was kept between the lowest and the highest levels of GENE1 expression ( data not shown ) . GENE1 showed a somewhat stronger effect in reversing the Smad7-mediated abrogation of TGF-beta-induced promoter activity ( maximum induction , 170-fold ) . Overexpression of GENE1 alone with the reporter construct strongly increased luciferase expression both in the presence ( maximum induction , 358-fold ) and absence of TGF-beta , when there was no suppressive effect of either OTHER_GENE alone or GENE2 and OTHER_GENE together . In spite of their 92 % sequence identity , OTHER_GENE and GENE1 are not functionally equivalent ( 14 ) . In contrast to GENE1 , OTHER_GENE increased the p3TP promoter activity weakly in response to TGF-beta as shown previously ( 42 ) ( Fig. 7B ) . OTHER_GENE , which was expressed efficiently ( data not shown ) , showed little effect in reversing the inhibition of TGF-beta-induced transcriptional responses by either OTHER_GENE alone or GENE2 and OTHER_GENE together . These experiments suggest that GENE1 , unlike OTHER_GENE , is able to strongly reverse the synergistic inhibition of TGF-beta-dependent transcription by GENE2 and OTHER_GENE .

Overexpression of GENE2 alone with the reporter construct strongly increased luciferase expression both in the presence ( maximum induction , 358-fold ) and absence of TGF-beta , when there was no suppressive effect of either OTHER_GENE alone or OTHER_GENE and OTHER_GENE together . In spite of their 92 % sequence identity , GENE1 and GENE2 are not functionally equivalent ( 14 ) . In contrast to GENE2 , GENE1 increased the p3TP promoter activity weakly in response to TGF-beta as shown previously ( 42 ) ( Fig. 7B ) . GENE1 , which was expressed efficiently ( data not shown ) , showed little effect in reversing the inhibition of TGF-beta-induced transcriptional responses by either OTHER_GENE alone or OTHER_GENE and OTHER_GENE together . These experiments suggest that GENE2 , unlike GENE1 , is able to strongly reverse the synergistic inhibition of TGF-beta-dependent transcription by OTHER_GENE and OTHER_GENE .
Since GENE1 and OTHER_GENE are centrally involved in mediating TGF-beta signals , we examined whether GENE1 or OTHER_GENE might affect the synergistic inhibition of TGF-beta-induced transcription by GENE2 and OTHER_GENE . As shown in Fig. 7A , cotransfection of GENE2 and OTHER_GENE in HepG2 cells strongly repressed the p3TP promoter activity . This inhibition of the TGF-beta-dependent activation of the promoter was reversed by OTHER_GENE in a dose-dependent manner ( maximum induction , 125-fold ) .

Suppression of GENE1 Kinase and Cellular Activities by GENE2
GENE1 inhibition of GENE2 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to sorbitol . CHO cells were cotransfected with pKH3-Pyk2 and pSG5 vectors encoding GENE1 , NT-FIP , CT-FIP , or pSG5 alone , as indicated . 2 d after transfection , cells were serum-starved for 24 h and treated with sorbitol ( 400 mM for 5 min ) . Lysates were immunoprecipitated by anti-Pyk2 and analyzed by Western blotting with either PY20 to assay the phosphorylation ( top ) or anti-Pyk2 to verify the expression levels of GENE2 ( middle ) . Aliquots of the lysates were also analyzed directly by Western blotting with anti-Flag to detect GENE1 or its fragments ( bottom ) .
GENE1 has growth-inhibitory effects that are partially reversed by GENE2 .
Given the differential phosphorylation of GENE1 at G1/S transition , we examined the potential effects of its forced expression on cell cycle progression . NIH 3T3 cells were transduced with retroviral vectors coexpressing GENE1 and GFP . The relative growth rates of cells stably expressing GENE1 plus GFP or GFP alone were determined by measuring BrdU incorporation . Cells transduced with GENE1 showed a 37 % decrease in growth rate compared to cells expressing GFP alone ( Fig. 7 ) , indicating growth-inhibitory effects that did not completely arrest the cells . To evaluate whether GENE2 proteins could override SUV39H1-induced growth inhibition , they were coexpressed with GENE1 using IRES-containing retroviruses . Constructs were confirmed to be expressing GENE1 and/or GENE2 in transduced cells by Western blotting . Coexpression of oncogenic GENE2 reversed the growth inhibition of GENE1 to 88 % of normal , whereas Sbf1HCS had no effect ( Fig. 7 ) . SUV39H1DeltaSET , which lacks a SET domain , also impaired the growth of NIH 3T3 cells , but in contrast to GENE1 its growth-inhibitory effects were not significantly reversed by GENE2 ( Fig. 7 ) . These data indicate that high levels of GENE1 partially inhibit cells from entry into S phase , implicating GENE1 in growth regulation . Furthermore , this property of GENE1 is modulated by GENE2 in a SET domain-dependent mechanism , suggesting that GENE1 may be a downstream target for the oncogenic GENE2 .
GENE1 has growth-inhibitory properties that are reversed by GENE2 . NIH 3T3 cells were transduced with retroviral stocks expressing GENE1 alone or in combination with GFP , GENE2 ( amino acids 1091 to 1861 ) , or Sbf1HCS ( indicated below histogram ) , using an IRES element . GENE1 and GENE2 protein expression in transduced cells was confirmed by Western blotting using anti-SUV39H1 and GENE2 antibodies . Growth rates were determined by measuring BrdU incorporation in equal numbers of transduced NIH 3T3 cells that were plated 24 h previously . Cells staining positively for BrdU incorporation were counted as a fraction of cells that expressed GFP ( growth fraction ) or total cells . The growth fraction of cells infected with GFP alone was arbitrarily set at 100 % , and percent growth rate was calculated accordingly . Western blots showing expression levels of exogenous GENE2 and Sbf1HCS are shown as insets above their corresponding panels . Presented data represent the means and standard deviations from three separate experiments . anti-s , cDNA insert in reverse orientation ; * , growth fraction was not significantly different from SUVDeltaSET alone ( P > 0.05 ) .
Since CDC28-VF cells are delayed in exiting mitosis , we investigated how they responded to a prolonged mitotic arrest caused by the spindle checkpoint . We examined the response to overexpressing the protein kinase GENE1 , which arrests cells in mitosis by activating the checkpoint , but does not damage the spindle ( Hardwick et al. 1996 ) . After about eight hours , wild-type cells overcome the arrest , divide , and resume proliferating . In contrast , CDC28-VF cells overexpressing GENE1 can not proliferate ( Fig. 2 A ) ; when individual cells are followed microscopically , many never divide , and the remainder go through only one or two divisions ( Fig. 2 B and data not shown ) . The cell cycle arrest and eventual lethality are completely suppressed by the GENE2 mutation , which inactivates the spindle checkpoint ( Li and Murray 1991 ; Hardwick et al. 2000 ) . GENE2 and GENE2 CDC28-VF cells divide as if there were no activation of the checkpoint . These results show that CDC28-VF cells , unlike wild-type , can not escape from mitosis in the presence of constant stimulation of the spindle checkpoint . CDC28-VF cells are also sensitive to other perturbations that activate the spindle checkpoint , including the presence of short linear chromosomes ( Wells and Murray 1996 ) and mutations that damage the spindle ( Hardwick et al. 1999 ) . Like GENE1 overexpression in CDC28-VF , these treatments are lethal and cause long delays in mitosis ( data not shown ) .
Because the CDC28-VF defect is not due to a lack of inhibitory phosphorylation , we asked if other mutations that affect mitotic Cdc28 activity might share phenotypes with CDC28-VF . OTHER_GENE - 1N , OTHER_GENE , and GENE1 - 38 ( a mutant in Cks1 , a Cdc28-binding protein required for passage through Start and mitosis ) are all more sensitive to GENE2 overexpression than wild-type ( Fig. 4 A ; Piggott et al. 1982 ; Hadwiger et al. 1989 ; Surana et al. 1991 ; Tang and Reed 1993 ) . This phenotype is not seen in OTHER_GENE - 4 , a temperature-sensitive allele of Cdc28 that prevents passage through Start and is primarily defective in the G1 function of Cdc28 ( Reed 1980 ) .

The mitotic defect of CDC28-VF is semidominant . The heterozygote CDC28/CDC28-VF has an intermediate sensitivity to GENE1 overexpression ( data not shown ) and overexpression of Cdc28-VF in otherwise wild-type cells creates cells that are fully sensitive to overexpressed GENE1 ( data not shown and Fig. 5 ) . These results suggest that Cdc28-VF is a dominant negative mutant , which competes with the wild-type kinase for substrates , mitotic cyclins , and Cks1 . In support of this idea , multiple copies of the GENE2 gene on a 2mu plasmid suppress the lethality of overexpressing GENE1 in a CDC28-VF strain ( Fig. 4 D ) . The semidominant phenotype of CDC28-VF does not reflect haploinsufficiency of Cdc28 , since CDC28/cdc28Delta diploids , which contain half as much Cdc28 as CDC28/CDC28 diploids , do not have a phenotype like CDC28-VF ( data not shown ) .
Because CDC28-VF impairs the exit from mitosis , crippling other pathways involved in this process might kill CDC28-VF cells . Our inability to make double mutants between CDC28-VF and mutants in the APC supports this idea ( Table ) . CDC28-VF is synthetically lethal in combination with mutations in components of the APC ( OTHER_GENE - 1 , OTHER_GENE - 1 , GENE1 - 1 , formerly doc1 - 1 ; Lamb et al. 1994 ; Irniger et al. 1995 ; Hwang and Murray 1997 ) and positive regulators of the APC ( OTHER_GENE - 1 , GENE2 and OTHER_GENE - 1 ; Schwab et al. 1997 ; Visintin et al. 1997 ; Charles et al. 1998 ; Shirayama et al. 1998 ) . These double mutants are inviable at all temperatures , and although the double mutant spores are able to germinate , they die in microcolonies of large-budded cells ( data not shown ) , indicating a terminal arrest in mitosis . These genetic interactions are specific to the APC and regulators of the APC , because two other mutants that arrest in mitosis , cdc13 - 1 ( which activates the DNA damage checkpoint ) and cdc15 - 2 ( which arrests cells in anaphase ) are both viable in combination with CDC28-VF .

These double mutants are inviable at all temperatures , and although the double mutant spores are able to germinate , they die in microcolonies of large-budded cells ( data not shown ) , indicating a terminal arrest in mitosis . These genetic interactions are specific to the APC and regulators of the APC , because two other mutants that arrest in mitosis , cdc13 - 1 ( which activates the DNA damage checkpoint ) and cdc15 - 2 ( which arrests cells in anaphase ) are both viable in combination with CDC28-VF .
Because CDC28-VF impairs the exit from mitosis , crippling other pathways involved in this process might kill CDC28-VF cells .

The interactions of OTHER_GENE alleles and OTHER_GENE with OTHER_GENE overexpression and the GENE1 - 1 mutant are correlated with each other : GENE2 - 1N , CDC28-F88 G , and OTHER_GENE are synthetically lethal in combination with GENE1 - 1 and can not proliferate when overexpressing OTHER_GENE , whereas GENE2 - 4 is viable in combination with GENE1 - 1 or OTHER_GENE overexpression ( Table II ; also , see Irniger et al. 1995 ) .

We overexpressed GENE1 and CDC28-VF in GENE2 - 1 cells that had been arrested by alpha factor and then released them from the arrest into fresh medium at 23 C , adding alpha factor after budding so that cells will rearrest when they reach the next G1 . Overexpression of CDC28-VF causes a permanent large-budded arrest with high levels of OTHER_GENE and OTHER_GENE ( Fig. 5 A ) . Sic1 levels never rise and Clb2-associated kinase activity never falls . Sister separation and spindle elongation are delayed by 2 h in cells expressing CDC28-VF ( Fig. 5 B and data not shown ) . These observations show that the induction of anaphase is delayed and the transition from anaphase to G1 is completely blocked in GENE2 - 1 CDC28-VF cells . These phenotypes are not due to activating the spindle checkpoint because neither mad2Delta nor mad2Delta bub2Delta bypass the arrest ( data not shown ; Hoyt et al. 1991 ; Li and Murray 1991 ; Alexandru et al. 1999 ) . Therefore , we conclude that CDC28-VF is defective in activating both the Cdc20-dependent APC , which triggers anaphase , and the Hct1-dependent APC , which completes cyclin proteolysis .

GENE1 and GENE2 Show a Genetic Interaction
Both published work ( Pemberton et al. 1997 ; Senger et al. 1998 ) and our current results demonstrate that Mtr10p functions as the major nuclear import pathway for Npl3p . However , deletion of GENE1 generated a temperature sensitive rather than lethal phenotype ( Pemberton et al. 1997 ) . In our hands , deletion of GENE1 resulted in no growth at 37 C ( data not shown ) but had little effect on growth at 30 C ( Fig. 5 b , top right ) . These observations suggest that Npl3p may also be imported through a separate pathway . Sky1p may also function in this parallel import pathway and/or downstream from the nuclear import step . In either case , simultaneous deletion of both GENE2 and GENE1 would result in a synthetic lethal phenotype . This prediction was confirmed as deletion of both GENE2 and GENE1 prevented cell growth at both 25 ( data not shown ) and 30 C ( Fig. 5 b , top left ) . These results , coupled with those of the overexpression suppression experiment , clearly establish a genetic interaction between GENE2 and GENE1 , and are complementary to the biochemical evidence for the function of Sky1p in nuclear import .
GENE1 and GENE2 show a genetic interaction . ( a ) Overexpression suppression of Npl3p localization defect . The left panels show localization of mutant GFP-npl3p(S411A ) in wild-type yeast containing empty vector ( p415 ) or a GAL-inducible plasmid overexpressing Mtr10p ( p415-MTR10 ) . The right panel shows a similar analysis on localization of wild-type GFP-Npl3p in sky1Delta yeast . ( b ) Synthetic lethality between GENE1 and GENE2 . A sky1Delta strain was first covered with a Ura+ plasmid containing GENE1 ( pRS316-SKY1 ) . Transformants with ( top left ) or without ( bottom right ) targeted disruption of GENE2 were streaked on a 5-FOA plate and incubated at 30 C. GENE1 ( bottom left ) or GENE2 ( top right ) deletion strains were used as controls .
The observation that GENE1 is required for estrogen signaling suggested that its activity may potentiate the coactivation of estrogen signaling by components of the SRC-1-CBP coactivator complex . To test this idea , transient transfection assays were performed to determine if overexpression of either OTHER_GENE or GENE2 was sufficient to activate estrogen signaling in the absence of GENE1 . In SW-13 cells , we observed that overexpression of OTHER_GENE was insufficient to coactivate estrogen signaling ; however , in the presence of exogenous GENE1 , OTHER_GENE significantly augmented BRG-1-mediated coactivation of estrogen signaling ( Fig. 1c ) . These studies suggest that BRG-1-mediated coactivation of estrogen signaling may be dramatically enhanced by OTHER_GENE and that the mechanisms by which OTHER_GENE mediates transcriptional coactivation are dependent on the actions of GENE1 . Similarly , we observed that in the absence of GENE1 , overexpression of GENE2 had only a modest effect on estrogen signaling and that in the presence of GENE1 , GENE2 enhanced coactivation to levels that were greater than those achieved by either GENE1 or GENE2 alone ( Fig. 1d ) . These studies suggest that GENE1 activity is required for the efficient coactivation of estrogen signaling by members of the OTHER_GENE and GENE2 families of transcriptional coregulators . Additionally , it is interesting that overexpression of either OTHER_GENE or GENE2 enhanced BRG-1-mediated coactivation of OTHER_GENE signaling , suggesting a functional cooperativity between the contributions of SRC-1-CBP and those of GENE1 .

The observation that either overexpression of SRC-1-CBP or treatment with TSA was capable of enhancing BRG-1-mediated coactivation of estrogen signaling suggests that GENE1 activity is regulated via the modulation of the acetylation state of a cell . Furthermore , the observed enhancement of GENE1 activity by TSA also implies that factors that decrease the acetylation state within a cell may negatively regulate the ability of GENE1 to function as a coactivator of ER signaling . To test this , we measured the effects of overexpression of GENE2 on the ability of GENE1 and TSA to function cooperatively in the coactivation of estrogen signaling . In these studies , we observed that overexpression of GENE2 significantly reduced BRG-1-mediated coactivation of estrogen signaling ( Fig. 4b ) . Additionally , the TSA-mediated enhancement of GENE1 activity was completely abolished by overexpression of GENE2 . These studies suggest that estrogen signaling may be negatively regulated by increased HDAC activity , which is consistent with studies correlating the activity of HATs and HDACs with positive and negative regulation of nuclear receptor function . These studies also support the conclusion that the ability of GENE1 to potentiate estrogen signaling is modulated by factors that regulate the acetylation state within a cell . Taken together , these studies support a model in which two distinct mechanisms by which the chemical and structural integrity of chromatin work cooperatively to support nuclear receptor activation .
GENE1 is required for OTHER_GENE signaling and for coactivation by OTHER_GENE and GENE2 . The BRG-1- and Brm-deficient adrenal carcinoma cell line was plated at 50,000 cells per well in 24-well dishes and transfected using FuGene according to the manufacturer 's protocol . All samples were similarly processed , and data represent the fold of induction by estrogen . All data are normalized to an internal estrogen-independent reporter ( tk-lacZ construct ) . ( a ) OTHER_GENE signaling is repressed in SW-13 cells in the absence of GENE1 . Overexpression of GENE1 elicited a sevenfold induction in response to estrogen . This induction was dependent on hormone and an intact AF-2 . ( b ) BRG-1-mediated coactivation of OTHER_GENE transcriptional activity is dependent on the ATPase activity of GENE1 . Transient transfection assays in SW-13 cells demonstrate that a point mutation in GENE1 that abolishes ATP binding also abolishes BRG-1-mediated coactivation of OTHER_GENE signaling . ( c ) Overexpression of OTHER_GENE in SW-13 cells fails to coactivate OTHER_GENE signaling but can enhance BRG-1-mediated coactivation of estrogen signaling , suggesting that OTHER_GENE activity requires functional GENE1 . ( c ) Overexpression of GENE2 fails to coactivate OTHER_GENE signaling in SW-13 cells but can enhance BRG-1-mediated coactivation of estrogen signaling , suggesting that this activity of GENE2 requires functional GENE1 . All experiments were carried out in triplicate ; error bars represent the standard error of the mean .

We then asked if OTHER_GENE ) , GENE1 , and OTHER_GENE collaborate in repressing Gli-mediated transcription in transfected HEK293 T cells . At low levels , OTHER_GENE ) caused a slight repression of Gli1-mediated transcription ( Figs. 2A and 3A ) , which was augmented by addition of GENE1 in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig. 3A ) . In the absence of OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE ) and GENE1 had little effect on the basal transcription activity ( Fig. 3A ) . The functional interaction between OTHER_GENE ) and GENE1 was further tested on the transcriptional response of GENE2 , which also has the ability to bind OTHER_GENE ) through the conserved N-terminal domain ( 18 , 28 ) . In HEK293 T cells , treatment of the sonic hedgehog ( Shh ) led to the induction of transcription from the 8xGliBS reporter ( Fig. 3B ) . Although OTHER_GENE augmented this Shh-induced transcription , GENE2 repressed it ( Fig. 3B ) , which is consistent with GENE2 undergoing proteolytic cleavage and acting as a transcription repressor ( 7 , 15 ) . Expression of OTHER_GENE ) in these cells inhibited the activator activity of OTHER_GENE but enhanced the repressor activity of GENE2 ( Fig. 3B ) . Coexpression of OTHER_GENE ) together with GENE1 and OTHER_GENE had an additive effect on the Gli3-mediated transcriptional repression , with maximum repression achieved when all four proteins are present ( Fig. 3C ) . Taken together , these results indicate that OTHER_GENE ) , GENE1 , and OTHER_GENE functionally interact to repress Gli-mediated transcription .

To test for the possibility that the proteins encoded by net1(7 m ) and net1(19 m ' ) might be hypomorphic with respect to their resistance toward phosphorylation by Cdc5 ( i.e. , not all Cdc5 phosphorylation sites on Net1 were mapped and mutated ) , we evaluated whether the GENE1 phosphosite-mutants exhibited a synthetic growth phenotype when combined with OTHER_GENE - 1 ( a mutant allele of CDC5 ) . This experiment was based on the idea that a reduction in phosphorylation sites on Net1 coupled with a reduction in Cdc5 activity might synergize to prevent efficient release of Cdc14 during anaphase , resulting in failure to exit mitosis . The net1(19 m ' ) but not net1(7 m ) allele showed a synthetic growth defect when combined with OTHER_GENE - 1 ( Figure 6E ) . The net1(19 m ' ) allele also showed a synthetic growth defect when combined with GENE2 - 1 . These observations imply that some of the residues mutated in net1(19 m ' ) represent in vivo phosphorylation sites that influence the MEN-dependent release of Cdc14 during anaphase .

A third hypothesis that stakes middle ground between these polar extremes is that Cdc5 affects RENT stability both directly and indirectly , with the former role being less significant than the latter . Several lines of evidence are consistent with this view . First , net1(7 m ) and net1(19 m ' ) mutants exerted a modest effect on release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus , in that ~40 % of cells with long mitotic spindles retained focal localization of Cdc14 and that both OTHER_GENE phospho-site mutants displayed a modest defect in ' Cdc14 early anaphase release ' ( FEAR ; [ 26 ] ) . Second , net1(19 m ' ) showed a synthetic growth defect when combined with GENE1 - 1 or the GENE2 - 1 allele of CDC5 . Third , phosphorylation site mapping of Net1 purified from arrested cdc14 - 1 cells ( WS and SC , unpublished data ) revealed that at least one ( S231 ) of the five in vivo phosphorylation sites in the first 341 amino acids was directly phosphorylated by Cdc5 in vitro . Nevertheless , because expression of neither Net1(7 m ) nor Net1(19 m ' ) had a major impact on exit from mitosis , any direct effect of Cdc5 on Net1 appears to be minor , and the requirement for Cdc5 in the release of Cdc14 might arise principally from phosphorylation of other release-promoting proteins .

The GENE1 coactivator enhances transcriptional activation mediated by GENE2 .
A GENE1 expression construct under the control of a heterologous promoter was transfected with pM-ProTalpha in HEK 293 cells . In this assay we show that the transcription activity mediated by GENE2 was enhanced in the presence of GENE1 and that this activity gradually increased when increasing amounts of GENE1 were introduced in the system . Specifically , the activity was increased by threefold , fourfold , and sixfold with increments of 5 mug of GENE1 ( Fig. 3 , left ) . These results suggest that GENE1 cooperates with GENE2 in enhancing basal transcription activity when targeted to the GAL4 promoter . Additionally , GENE1 by itself does not dramatically enhance the levels of activation , as it does when cooperating with GENE2 , suggesting that the increased activity is dependent on the association of GENE2 with GENE1 ( Fig. 3 , right ) . Western blots showing increasing levels of GENE2 and GENE1 suggest that the activity is dependent on the levels of protein expressed compared to background level of a nonspecific protein .
The GENE1 coactivator enhances the transcription activation mediated by GENE2 . The GENE1 expression vector was transfected in increasing amounts along with pM-ProTalpha in a luciferase assay . All transfections were normalized for transfection efficiencies and total DNA . Transfected cultures were harvested after 24 h of incubation at 37 C. The GENE1 expression construct was added in increments of 5 mug without pM-ProTalpha . Relative luciferase units ( RLU ) were measured for 10 s with an MGM luminometer ( Optocomp1 ) , and means of three experiments are shown . A Western blot ( WB ) assay for GENE2 and GENE1 levels and for those of the protein loading control used for comparison is shown at the bottom .
Given the ability of GENE1 to associate with GENE2 and class II HDACs , we performed experiments to determine whether or not GENE1 contributes to the mechanism by which these factors repress MEF2-dependent transcription . As shown in Fig. 4C , HP1alpha was capable of repressing a MEF2-dependent reporter gene in a dose-dependent manner , and the inhibitory action of GENE1 was enhanced by a small amount of exogenous GENE2 . These results suggest that GENE1 is recruited to MEF2 via GENE2 and class II HDACs to form a more potent transcriptional repression complex .
Interestingly , coexpression of heterodimeric GENE1 together with GENE2 produced a rounded morphology and detachment of the cells ( Fig. 4 C ) . This morphological change was reversed by treatment with 100 nM of the PI3 K inhibitor wortmannin in approximately half of the cells within 30 min , and not seen when a kinase-deficient YFP-p110gamma-K833R mutant was used ( Fig. 4 C ) . Hence , the morphological change was related to the enzymatic activity of GENE1 stimulated by the coexpressed GENE2 .
In addition to p115RhoGEF , two mammalian RhoGEFs , OTHER_GENE ( KIAA0380 ) and GENE1 , were identified to have an RGS domain in their N-terminal region ( refs . 18 and 22 ; Fig. 1A ) . It was shown that OTHER_GENE and GENE1 interacted with constitutively active mutants of OTHER_GENE and GENE2 through their RGS domains ( 23 , 24 ) . However , the biochemical mechanism to regulate the RhoGEF activity of OTHER_GENE or GENE1 by Galpha12/13 has not been elucidated . To examine whether OTHER_GENE or GENE1 can mediate the signal from OTHER_GENE or GENE2 to Rho activation , we first performed SRE-luciferase reporter assays . It has already been shown that Galpha12/13-mediated Rho activation could be monitored in cells by SRF activation ( 25 ) . As shown in Fig. 1B , overexpression of a constitutively active mutant of OTHER_GENE ( Galpha12Q229L ) or GENE2 ( Galpha13Q226L ) modestly stimulated SRF activity , whereas coexpression of these mutants with GENE1 or OTHER_GENE synergistically potentiated SRF activation . In particular , SRF activation by OTHER_GENE or GENE1 and OTHER_GENE was almost similar to the level with these RhoGEFs and GENE2 . We could not detect similar synergistic SRF activation by using p115RhoGEF in the assay . The results suggest that OTHER_GENE or GENE1 may transduce the signal from both OTHER_GENE and GENE2 to Rho activation . In this study , we focused on the function of GENE1 in G12/13-mediated signaling .

Because the involvement of GENE1 kinase has been reported in the Galpha12-mediated pathway , we tested the possibility that GENE1 tyrosine kinase might be involved in Rho activation through Galpha12/13-LARG . As shown in Fig. 3A , coexpression of GENE1 kinase in HeLa cells potently stimulated both Galpha12- and Galpha13-LARG-mediated SRF activation . However , we did not observe a similar effect of GENE1 when Galpha12/13 or GENE2 was expressed alone . Coexpression of GENE1 did not stimulate SRF activation mediated by Galpha12/13-p115RhoGEF ( data not shown ) . In addition , a kinase-deficient mutant of GENE1 ( Tec-KD ) failed to stimulate the Galpha12/13-LARG-mediated SRF activation . GTP-bound Rho pull-down assay also demonstrated that Rho activation by Galpha12-LARG in HeLa cells was further stimulated by GENE1 ( Fig. 3B ) . These results suggest that GENE1 tyrosine kinase regulates Galpha12/13-LARG-mediated Rho activation by phosphorylating some component of the pathway .
Expression constructs for dominant stable GENE1 , GENE2 , and DeltaNTCF-4E ( Fig. 1B ) were transiently transfected into 293 T cells along with pTOPFLASH or the negative control pFOPFLASH . As expected , ectopic expression of GENE1 increased reporter gene activity ( Fig. 2 ) . Cotransfection of increasing amounts of GENE2 progressively decreased the reporter activity in response to GENE1 , similar to the inhibitory effect of the well-established dominant negative form of TCF , DeltaNTCF-4E ( Fig. 2 ) ( 44 ) . GENE2 had no effect on reporter activity in the absence of ectopic GENE1 ( data not shown ) . In addition , neither GENE1 nor GENE2 influenced gene expression from pFOPFLASH , in which the TCF binding sites are mutated ( Fig. 2 ) . These results indicate that GENE2 acts through a dominant negative mechanism to inhibit activation by GENE1 of a TCF-responsive promoter .
GENE1 and GENE2 synergize to activate transcription from non-TCF-responsive promoters .
GENE1 inhibits activation by GENE2 of the TCF-responsive promoter gene pTOPFLASH ( Fig. 2 ) . To determine the effect of GENE1 and GENE2 on what has been reported to be a TCF-dependent promoter , we performed luciferase reporter assays with the human cyclin D1 promoter ( cyclin D1-luc ) , which contains one TCF/LEF consensus site and four cryptic binding sites ( 40 , 44 ) . While GENE2 activated the cyclin D1 promoter ( Fig. 3A ) , GENE1 alone had no effect ( data not shown ) . In contrast to our hypothesis that GENE1 would inhibit cyclin D1 promoter activity , cotransfection of GENE1 with GENE2 caused an increase in reporter gene expression even in the absence of TCF binding sites , i.e. , mtTCF(1 ) and mtTCF(0 - 4 ) ( Fig. 3A ) . Cotransfection of DeltaNTCF-4N had no effect on GENE2 activation of the cyclin D1 promoter ( data not shown ) , indicating that the N terminus of GENE1 is necessary for its effect . beta-Catenin activated the mutant cyclin D1 reporter genes independent of DNA binding by TCF/LEF , because cotransfection of DeltaNTCF-4E did not reduce promoter activity for either mutant reporter gene ( Fig. 3A ) . Furthermore , the increase in promoter activity by cotransfection of GENE1 , despite mutations in the putative TCF binding sites , suggests that GENE2 activates transcription via interactions with transcription factors other than TCF/LEFs .
To explore the possibility that OTHER_GENE potentiates coactivation by GENE1 of GENE2 , we performed reporter assays with the SF-1-dependent inhibin promoter ( inhibin-luc ) ( 16 , 23 ) . Expression of GENE2 induced inhibin promoter activity , and cotransfection of GENE1 resulted in an increase above that with GENE2 alone ( Fig. 4A ) . Cotransfection of increasing amounts of OTHER_GENE synergized with GENE1 and GENE2 to stimulate a greater than 2.5-fold increase in inhibin promoter activity . The induction of inhibin promoter activity by OTHER_GENE , GENE1 , and GENE2 was not influenced by coexpression with the well-established dominant negative TCF DeltaNTCF-4E ( data not shown ) , indicating that the effects are not mediated through TCF/LEF DNA binding sites . The effects of GENE1 and OTHER_GENE were largely dependent upon the presence of GENE2 ( Fig. 4A ) . Our data suggest that GENE1 and OTHER_GENE synergize to coactivate the orphan nuclear receptor GENE2 .

To verify the functional interaction between GENE1 and a complex containing OTHER_GENE and OTHER_GENE , we used a LexA-dependent reporter gene and a fusion construct in which the GENE1 DNA binding domain was replaced with the LexA DNA binding domain ( GENE2 ) . Expression of GENE2 stimulated an increase in reporter gene activity , and this was further increased by cotransfection of GENE2 with OTHER_GENE ( Fig. 4B ) . Coactivation of GENE2 by OTHER_GENE was almost doubled by coexpression of OTHER_GENE , consistent with our prior observations with the inhibin promoter ( Fig. 4A ) . In contrast , cotransfection of OTHER_GENE and OTHER_GENE without GENE1 resulted in no increase in promoter activity ( data not shown ) . These data demonstrate that OTHER_GENE potentiates the coactivation of GENE1 by OTHER_GENE .

GENE1 and GENE2 synergize to coactivate C/EBPalpha .
Given the emerging concept that GENE1 coactivates transcription factors other than TCF/LEFs , we explored the possibility that GENE1 and GENE2 coactivate OTHER_GENE , a transcription factor important for adipogenesis . To determine if GENE1 and GENE2 functionally interact with OTHER_GENE , we performed reporter gene assays with the leptin promoter ( Leptin-luc and mtLeptin-luc ) . The leptin promoter contains a C/EBP binding site and has been shown to be OTHER_GENE responsive ( 12 , 15 ) . Expression of OTHER_GENE increased leptin reporter gene activity , and coexpression of OTHER_GENE and GENE1 resulted in an additive increase ( Fig. 5A ) . Cotransfection of GENE2 with OTHER_GENE and GENE1 resulted in a synergistic activation of the leptin promoter that was dependent upon the OTHER_GENE binding site ( Fig. 5A ) . The well-established dominant negative TCF DeltaNTCF-4E did not influence the increase of reporter activity by GENE2 , OTHER_GENE , and GENE1 ( data not shown ) . In addition , GENE2 had no effect on OTHER_GENE activation of the leptin promoter in the absence of exogenous GENE1 ( data not shown ) . The lack of inhibition by DeltaNTCF-4E suggests that GENE1 and GENE2 enhance OTHER_GENE activity through a mechanism that is independent of TCF/LEF DNA binding . Because 293 T cells express little or no endogenous OTHER_GENE and GENE1 increased leptin promoter activity even in the absence of OTHER_GENE binding sites ( Fig. 5A ) , it appears that GENE1 also interacts with other transcriptional regulators of the leptin promoter . Our data suggest that a complex containing GENE1 and GENE2 induces leptin promoter activity specifically through coactivation of OTHER_GENE .

To verify the functional interactions between GENE1 , GENE2 , and OTHER_GENE , we performed luciferase assays with a Gal4-C/EBPalpha expression construct and a Gal4-responsive reporter gene ( Fig. 5B ) . The Gal4-C/EBPalpha chimeric protein consists of the Gal4 DNA binding domain and the OTHER_GENE transactivation domain truncated prior to the leucine zipper . Transfection of Gal4-C/EBPalpha increased reporter gene activity by almost 10-fold ( Fig. 5B ) . While coexpression of GENE1 with Gal4-C/EBPalpha did not greatly alter promoter activity , GENE2 synergized with these factors to dramatically increase promoter activity . The effects of GENE2 required expression of both Gal4-C/EBPalpha and GENE1 ( data not shown ) . These data provide strong evidence that GENE1 and GENE2 are transcriptional coactivators for OTHER_GENE .

GENE1 partially rescues the block of differentiation by ectopic expression of GENE2 .
The ability of GENE1 to partially relieve the inhibition of 3T3-L1 adipogenesis caused by GENE2 supports the evidence from reporter gene assays that GENE1 potentiates coactivation by GENE2 of non-TCF/LEF transcription factors , including the positive regulator of adipogenesis C/EBPalpha ( Fig. 5 ) . Rescue of the inhibition of GENE2 by GENE1 could potentially be due to inhibition of TCF/LEF-dependent transcription and/or activation of C/EBPalpha and other adipogenic transcription factors . Coactivation of C/EBPalpha by GENE2 is paradoxical , given the inhibitory effect of Wnt signaling and dominant-stable GENE2 on adipogenesis . Interestingly , nuclear GENE2 levels remained elevated for 3 days after induction of adipocyte differentiation ( Fig. 5C ) , despite a decline in the Wnt10b and Frizzled receptors ( 1 ) . Levels of the adipogenic transcription factors C/EBPalpha and PPARgamma increased during this time and peaked 3 days after induction of differentiation . Since GENE2 declined after induction of many adipocyte markers and the accumulation of lipid , it appears that GENE2 has a more complex role during adipogenesis than the strictly antagonistic function predicted by its role in the canonical Wnt signaling pathway .
While the mechanism whereby OTHER_GENE potentiates transcriptional coactivation by OTHER_GENE does not appear to involve regulation of OTHER_GENE stability , tyrosine phosphorylation , or subcellular localization , the positive effect of OTHER_GENE on OTHER_GENE may be through the recruitment of transcriptional coactivators . It is well established that OTHER_GENE physically and functionally interacts with GENE1 and CBP ( 10 , 24 , 43 ) . OTHER_GENE may stabilize these interactions , because OTHER_GENE greatly increased the coactivation of GENE2 by GENE1 and OTHER_GENE ( Fig. 6D ) . Furthermore , OTHER_GENE may recruit additional coactivators to the complex that are not recruited by OTHER_GENE or GENE1 alone .

It is well established that GENE1 physically and functionally interacts with OTHER_GENE and CBP ( 10 , 24 , 43 ) . OTHER_GENE may stabilize these interactions , because OTHER_GENE greatly increased the coactivation of GENE2 by OTHER_GENE and GENE1 ( Fig. 6D ) .

cdc48-td cells arrest in both G1 and G2/M at 37 C , and GENE1 deletion or GENE2 constitutive expression can overcome the G1 arrest . ( A ) Asynchronous wild-type ( CDC48 ) and cdc48-td cells grown in glucose medium at 25 C were either transferred to galactose medium at 25 C to induce UBR1 for 1 h and then shifted to 37 C , or kept in glucose medium at 25 C. Nocodazole or alpha factor was added to aliquots of cells at 25 and 37 C , and samples were harvested for flow cytometry and budding index analysis 4 h later . % Budded ( Large ) , percentages of budded cells and of large-budded cells ( in parentheses , defined as those with bud size of at least 60 % of the mother ) among all budded cells .

Far1p degradation is mediated through the G1 ubiquitin-conjugating system composed of Cdc34p , Cdc4p , Cdc53p , and Skp1p ( Henchoz et al. , 1997 ; Blondel et al. , 2000 ) . We asked if the function of Cdc48p in Far1p degradation is through the G1 proteolysis pathway by testing if double mutants in CDC48 and CDC34 had synthetic lethality interactions . Haploid GENE1 - 3 and GENE2 - 1 single mutants in the same strain background were crossed , tetrads analysis was performed , and the segregants were incubated at 25 C. The colonies were replica plated and incubated at 25 , 30 , and 37 C to examine the growth of the spores . 19 tetrads were analyzed and 13 tetratypes , 2 parental ditypes , and 4 nonparental ditypes were found , nearly matching the expected radio . Of the 21 GENE1 - 3 GENE2 - 1 double mutants , eight failed to form colonies and arrested growth as microcolonies , each with roughly 100 cells on tetrad dissection plates at 25 C ( unpublished data ) . The double mutants that did form small colonies grew much more slowly than did the GENE1 - 3 and GENE2 - 1 single mutants at 25 C ; and unlike the single mutants , the double mutants were nonviable at 30 C ( Fig. 4 D ) . The synthetic growth defects of the GENE1 - 3 GENE2 - 1 double mutants are consistent with Cdc48p and Cdc34p being involved in the same pathway , which is likely to be degradation of Far1p .
In this study , we investigated the functional roles of Fli-I and GENE1 in regulating transcriptional activation by beta-catenin and LEF1/TCF . GENE1 is a key activator , cooperating synergistically with GENE2 to mediate transcriptional activation by beta-catenin and LEF1/TCF . This synergy of GENE1 and GENE2 was negatively regulated by Fli-I. This study suggests that the interplay of Fli-I and GENE1 may be one of the important regulation mechanisms of the beta-catenin dependent , Wnt signaling pathway .
LEF1/TCF-mediated transcription was examined by transfection of the pGL3OT-Luc or TOPflash-luc reporter plasmid ( regulated by binding sites for LEF1/TCF ) into mammalian cells . Over-expression of OTHER_GENE activated the TOPflash reporter in 293 T cells ( Figure 1A , bar 2 ) and transfection of increasing amounts of GENE1 expression plasmid led to a dramatic activation of LEF1/TCF-dependent transcription ( bars 3 - 5 ) . In contrast , over-expression of Fli-I did not affect transcription activation by OTHER_GENE and LEF1/TCF ( bars 9 - 11 ) . GENE2 also cooperated with OTHER_GENE to enhance LEF1/TCF-dependent transcription ( bars 6 - 8 ) as previously shown ( 9,10 ) .

GENE1 and OTHER_GENE independently enhanced the transcriptional activity of GENE2 tethered to GAL4 DBD ( Figure 4A , bars 3 and 4 ) . However , when both GENE1 and OTHER_GENE were co-expressed , the beta-catenin-dependent transcription was synergistically activated ( bar 5 ) . In addition , GENE1 and OTHER_GENE independently enhanced LEF1/TCF-dependent transcription in the presence of GENE2 ( Figure 4B , bars 4 - 6 ) . However , the co-expression of GENE1 , OTHER_GENE and GENE2 caused synergistic enhancement of LEF1/TCF mediated transcription ( bar 8) . The coactivator synergy of GENE1 and OTHER_GENE was not observed without the expression of GENE2 ( bar 7 ) , consistent with our finding that GENE1 does not bind to LEF1/TCF ( Figure 3A ) . The synergy of GENE1 and OTHER_GENE was also observed in TOPflash reporter assay system ( Figure 4C , bar 5 ) , but not with FOPflash reporter ( which has mutant TCF/LEF binding sites ) ( bar 10 ) . This shows that the synergy of GENE1 and OTHER_GENE is dependent upon the binding of LEF1/TCF to DNA .

OTHER_GENE was previously characterized as a coactivator for NRs and OTHER_GENE functions synergistically with GRIP1 and CARM1 as a coactivator for NRs ( 20 ) . Since OTHER_GENE also binds to GENE1 ( 32 ) and inhibits GENE2 mediated transcription ( Figure 1B ) , we investigated the effect of OTHER_GENE on the synergy of GENE1 and OTHER_GENE . As previously shown ( Figure 4 ) , GENE1 and OTHER_GENE synergistically enhanced transcriptional activation by GENE2 fused to GAL4 DBD ( bar 8 , Figure 5A ) . However , the coactivator synergy of GENE1 and OTHER_GENE was inhibited severely by co-transfection of increasing amounts of OTHER_GENE expression vectors ( lanes 9 - 13 ) . The LRR and gelsolin-like fragments of OTHER_GENE were less effective inhibitors of GENE2 mediated transcription ( bars 5 - 8 , Figure 5B ) , although they are expressed at higher levels than full length OTHER_GENE ( 20 ) . This suggests that functions of both the LRR and gelsolin-like domains are required for the inhibitory activity of Fli-I. Thus , although OTHER_GENE cooperates synergistically in GRIP1 coactivator complexes with NRs , OTHER_GENE negatively regulates the activity of GENE2 coactivator complexes . As an initial investigation of the mechanism of this negative regulation , we tested whether OTHER_GENE fragments might inhibit binding of GENE1 to OTHER_GENE . However , the LRR and Gelsolin-like fragments of OTHER_GENE bound weakly or not at all to the OTHER_GENE KIX domain ( Supplementary Figure 6E and data not shown ) . We further tested whether the LRR and Gelsolin-like fragments of OTHER_GENE could interfere with the binding of GENE1 to the OTHER_GENE KIX domain fused to GST . However , when 5-fold excess levels of in vitro translated LRR and Gelsolin-like fragments were mixed and incubated with in vitro translated GENE1 and bead-bound GST-KIX , there was no reduction in binding of GENE1 to the beads ( Supplementary Figure 6F ) , suggesting that OTHER_GENE does not interfere with the binding of GENE1 to OTHER_GENE . Thus , the mechanism for the inhibitory effect of OTHER_GENE on the coactivator function of GENE2 , GENE1 and OTHER_GENE remains to be determined .

To assess the functional significance of the SRC3-myocardin interaction , we tested whether GENE1 affects myocardin-mediated transactivation of two SRF-responsive , CArG-containing smooth muscle-specific promoters , the SM22 and the smooth muscle MHC genes ( 37 ) . Myocardin alone resulted in transactivation of the SM22 reporter in HEK293 cells ( Fig. 6A ) . Cotransfection of plasmids encoding full-length GENE1 or the GENE1 bHLH/PAS domain [ SRC(1 - 450 ) ] further increased myocardin-mediated transcriptional activation in a dose-dependent fashion ( Fig. 6A ) . GENE1 enhanced GENE2 activity by 3.8-fold ( P < 0.003 , n = 3 ) , and SRC3(1 - 450 ) alone enhanced GENE2 activity 2.7-fold ( P < 0.0001 , n = 3 ) . GENE1 or SRC3(1 - 450 ) alone did not transactivate the SM22 - 445-luc reporter ( Fig. 6A ) . GENE1 also augmented activation of a second CArG-containing , SRF-dependent VSMC gene by GENE2 , the smMHC-luc reporter [ increase caused by full-length GENE1 coactivation of GENE2 , P < 0.03 ; increase caused by SRC3(1 - 450 ) coactivation of GENE2 , P < 0.05 ; Fig. 6B ] . GENE1 also modestly coactivated GENE2 transactivation of a VSMC-specific reporter in PAC1 smooth muscle cells ( Fig. 6C ) . Myocardin interacts with SRF , an important VSMC transcription factor that controls the expression of a number of VSMC-specific genes . To exclude the possibility that the GENE1 effect on myocardin-mediated transactivation was indirect , through SRF , we used a Gal fusion reporter transcriptional assay to examine directly the effect of GENE1 on GENE2 transactivation ( Fig. 6D ) . Gal-myocd(715 - 935 ) activated a Gal4 DNA binding reporter DBD-tk-luciferase 382-fold , and cotransfection of GENE1 or SRC3(1 - 450 ) further significantly increased Gal-myocd(715 - 935 ) activity 2.35- or 2.1-fold on this reporter ( P < 0.01 and P < 0.04 , respectively ) . Together , these data support that GENE1 coactivates VSMC-specific gene expression through a direct interaction with the GENE2 C-terminal TAD . However , despite numerous studies in which ERalpha was cotransfected with GENE2 in the absence or presence of estradiol , no effect of estrogen on SRC3-mediated coactivation of GENE2 on VSMC-specific reporters ( see Discussion ) .
GENE1 augments GENE2 transactivation of vascular smooth muscle-specific promoters . Dose-dependent coactivation of GENE2 transcriptional activation by GENE1 is shown . ( A and B ) Increasing amounts of mammalian expression plasmids pRSV-CBP , pCMX-SRC3(1 - 450 ) , or pCMX-SRC3 ( - , 0 mug ; + , 100 ng ; + + + , 300 ng ) were transfected into HEK293 cells with 1 ng of pcDNA-myocardin and either the SM22 - 445lucifease reporter ( A ) or smMHC-luciferase reporter construct ( B ) . ( C ) GENE1 enhances GENE2 transactivation of the SM22 reporter in vascular smooth muscle PAC1 cells . Relative fold activation in A-C was determined by comparison with the basal SM22 - 445 luciferase activity or smMHC-luciferase when transfected with control CMX vector . Data are expressed as the mean + - SD of triplicates from a representative experiment of three independent experiments . Asterisks represent P for comparison of data between GENE1 coactivation and vector only . * , P < 0.02 . ( D ) GENE1 enhances Gal-myocardin TAD activation in Gal4 DBD-luciferase reporter system . Myocardin C-TAD from amino acids 715 - 935 was expressed as Gal4-DBD fusion protein in the pCMX-Gal vector .
To examine the effect of GENE1 on GENE2 transactivation in situ in HEK293 and PAC1 cells , we used small RNA interference to diminish endogenous GENE1 expression and performed reporter assays . A 21-bp double-stranded GENE1 siRNA oligo from GENE1 nucleotides 415 - 434 or nonspecific control ( scrambled ) RNA were transiently transfected into HEK293 or PAC1 cells , followed by cotransfection of pcDNA-myocardin or vector and the SM22 reporter . The inhibition of GENE1 expression resulted in a 55 % reduction in GENE2 transactivation of the SM22 reporter ( Fig. 7A ) . Similar results were obtained in PAC1 cells ( Fig. 7B ) , supporting further that GENE1 is required for the complete transactivation of the smooth muscle-specific , CArG-containing SM22 promoter by GENE2 .
Knockdown of GENE1 with siRNA reduces GENE2 transactivation of VSMC-specific reporters . HEK293 ( A ) or PAC1 ( B ) cells were transfected with 75 nM of GENE1 siRNA ( siSRC3 ) or control scrambled oligo duplex and then cotransfected with 10 ng ( A ) or 50 ng ( B ) of pcDNA-myocardin or pcDNA vector and SM22 - 445luciferase reporter together with 50 ng CMX-beta-gal as an internal control . Results shown are mean values of three independent experiments in triplicate . In A , * , P < 0.013 ; in B , * , P < 0.043 . GENE1 protein was assayed by immunoblotting , and expression levels of GAPDH ( A ) or lamin A ( B ) were used as protein loading controls .
We investigated the function of OTHER_GENE in the GENE1 pathway in greater detail with a combined genetic and biochemical approach . We transformed the OTHER_GENE - 3 and GENE2 mutants with a high-copy plasmid ( designated [ GENE1 ] ) in which OTHER_GENE was overexpressed ( Fig. 5 , A and B ) . Overexpression of GENE1 specifically restored growth to the OTHER_GENE - 3 mutant at 37 C on glucose media ; however , the petite-negative phenotype was not reversed ( Fig. 5 A ) . In contrast to studies by Pfanner and Jensen and colleagues ( Kovermann et al. , 2002 ) , GENE1 overexpression did not suppress the growth defect or the petite-negativity in the GENE2 strain ( Fig. 5 A ) , indicating that GENE1 suppression is dependent on the presence of the OTHER_GENE gene and that the OTHER_GENE - 3 mutant protein ( albeit undetectable by immunoblot ) is required for growth at 37 C. Also , GENE1 overexpression did not suppress the growth defect on rich ethanol-glycerol media at 37 C , demonstrating that OTHER_GENE - 3 phenocopies the Deltayme1 mutant ( Fig. 5 B ) . We also tested cold-sensitivity at 15 C on rich glucose media ( Fig. S2 , available at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200706195/DC1 ) . Like the Deltayme1 mutant , GENE2 and OTHER_GENE - 3 strains displayed cold sensitivity , which was not restored upon GENE1 overexpression ( Fig. S2 ) . In addition , the abundance of OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , AAC , and OTHER_GENE increased in OTHER_GENE - 3 mitochondria overexpressing OTHER_GENE ( Fig. 5 C ) , and import was restored to near-WT levels for substrates of the GENE1 pathway ( Fig. 5 D ; Fig. S3 ) . This analysis indicates that overexpression of OTHER_GENE restores defects associated with protein import and growth in the OTHER_GENE - 3 mutant , supporting the hypothesis that OTHER_GENE functions as a stabilizing scaffold/assembly factor for the GENE1 complex .

This analysis indicates that overexpression of OTHER_GENE restores defects associated with protein import and growth in the OTHER_GENE - 3 mutant , supporting the hypothesis that GENE1 functions as a stabilizing scaffold/assembly factor for the OTHER_GENE complex .
We investigated the function of GENE1 in the OTHER_GENE pathway in greater detail with a combined genetic and biochemical approach . We transformed the OTHER_GENE - 3 and OTHER_GENE mutants with a high-copy plasmid ( designated [ OTHER_GENE ] ) in which GENE2 was overexpressed ( Fig. 5 , A and B ) . Overexpression of OTHER_GENE specifically restored growth to the OTHER_GENE - 3 mutant at 37 C on glucose media ; however , the petite-negative phenotype was not reversed ( Fig. 5 A ) . In contrast to studies by Pfanner and Jensen and colleagues ( Kovermann et al. , 2002 ) , OTHER_GENE overexpression did not suppress the growth defect or the petite-negativity in the OTHER_GENE strain ( Fig. 5 A ) , indicating that OTHER_GENE suppression is dependent on the presence of the OTHER_GENE gene and that the OTHER_GENE - 3 mutant protein ( albeit undetectable by immunoblot ) is required for growth at 37 C. Also , OTHER_GENE overexpression did not suppress the growth defect on rich ethanol-glycerol media at 37 C , demonstrating that OTHER_GENE - 3 phenocopies the Deltayme1 mutant ( Fig. 5 B ) .

Overexpression of GENE1 in GENE2 - 3 mitochondria restores viability on rich glucose media and protein import , but not petite-negativity . ( A ) The GENE2 - 3 and Deltatim54 mutants were transformed with a 2mu plasmid overexpressing GENE1 ( designated as [ GENE1 ] ) in strain GA74 . Individual transformants were serially diluted as described in Fig. 1 B onto rich glucose media in the presence and absence of ethidium bromide . Restoration of growth was tested at 37 C for the rich glucose media and 25 C for petite-negativity . ( B ) The WT , Deltayme1 , Deltatim54 , GENE2 - 3 , and GENE2 - 3 + [ GENE1 ] strains ( background GA74 ) were plated onto rich ethanol-glyercol media and incubated at 25 C and 37 C. Plates were photographed after 3 d. ( C ) The steady-state levels of Tim54p , Tim22p , Tim23p , Yme1p , AAC , and porin were investigated as described in Fig. 4 A in mitochondria derived from the GENE2 - 3 mutant and from the GENE2 - 3 mutant overexpressing GENE1 ( designated GENE2 - 3[TIM22 ] ) . The asterisk denotes immunoreactivity toward porin . ( D ) Import rates for substrates of the GENE1 pathway , AAC ( top ) and the phosphate carrier ( PiC ; bottom ) , were analyzed as described in Fig. 4 C.
Given that the petite-negative phenotype and the respiratory-deficiency at 37 C could not be restored by overexpression of TIM22 , we focused on OTHER_GENE assembly and function . First , we evaluated OTHER_GENE import into mitochondria defective in tim22 , tim23 , and GENE1 , as well as the GENE1 - 3 mitochondria with overexpressed TIM22 ( Fig. S5 A , available at http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200706195/DC1 ) . OTHER_GENE contains a typical N-terminal targeting sequence that is cleaved , presumably by the matrix processing peptidase , upon import ( Klanner et al. , 2001 ; Arnold and Langer , 2002 ) ; as such , OTHER_GENE is predicted to use the TIM23 import pathway because of its typical presequence ( Van Dyck and Langer , 1999 ) . The OTHER_GENE import rate was decreased in tim22 - 19 and tim23 - 2 mutant mitochondria ( Fig. S5 A ) . Despite the decreased rate of import , however , OTHER_GENE was present at WT levels in tim22 - 19 and tim23 - 2 mitochondria ( Fig. 7 A ) . In addition , the rate of OTHER_GENE into GENE1 mutant mitochondria was impaired ( Fig. S5 A ) , but Yme1 was detected in mutant GENE1 mitochondria ( Fig. 2 A and Fig. 5C ) . Finally , overexpression of GENE2 restored the rate of import ( Fig. S5 A ) . Whereas OTHER_GENE import is impaired , OTHER_GENE still accumulates to levels that are detectable in WT mitochondria .

In addition to mutations in yme1 , several defects in mitochondrial function contribute to petite-negativity in yeast . Other components involved in mitochondrial biogenesis are inviable when the mitochondrial genome is lost in particular genetic backgrounds ( Dunn and Jensen , 2003 ; Senapin et al. , 2003 ) ; certain strains lacking functional Tim18p , Tom70p , and Tim9p can not tolerate loss of the mitochondrial genome . For Tom70p and Tim18p , Jensen and colleagues suggested that the decreased import efficiency in combination with a decreased membrane potential resulted in lethality when the mitochondrial genome was absent and overexpression of cytosolic proteins that improved import efficiency could suppress the defect ( Dunn and Jensen , 2003 ) ; these studies suggest that the pathways to maintain a membrane potential are obviously complex . Surprisingly , overexpression of TIM22 in GENE1 mutant mitochondria did not suppress the petite-negativity or the respiratory deficiency at 37 C. In addition , overexpression of GENE2 ( Dunn and Jensen , 2003 ) suppressed petite-negativity in the OTHER_GENE strain , but not GENE1 - 3 . These results argue that the petite-negativity caused by a defect in GENE1 is not the result of a combined impairment in import efficiency and a decrease in membrane potential . AAC function and abundance also is critical for maintaining a membrane potential in the absence of a mitochondrial genome ( Contamine and Picard , 2000 ) . Because AAC depends on the TIM22 import pathway for biogenesis and AAC levels are lower in the Deltatim54 and GENE1 - 3 mutants , defects in AAC function may contribute to petite- negativity in these mutant strains . However , because our tim22 , tim9 , and tim10 mutants , all with severely lowered levels of AAC , are petite-positive ( Fig. 1 B and Fig. 3 C ) and AAC levels are increased when TIM22 is overexpressed in the GENE1 - 3 mutant , our data that GENE1 mutants are petite-negative support the postulation that Tim54p has an alternative function in mitochondrial biogenesis , namely assembly of Yme1p .

Additional evidence that Edc3p affects , but is not required for , P-body assembly is that the large P-bodies that form in GENE1 or OTHER_GENE strains because of the resulting defects in decapping and 5'-to-3 ' degradation ( Sheth and Parker , 2003 ; Teixeira and Parker , 2007 ) are reduced but not eliminated in GENE1 GENE2 and OTHER_GENE GENE2 strains ( Fig. 1 B ) .

An important result was that the GENE1 GENE2 strain was defective in P-body formation during glucose deprivation ( Fig. 5 A , right ) . In contrast , deletion of the C terminus of Lsm4 protein by itself did not reduce P-bodies during mid-log growth or have a strong effect on P-body formation in response to glucose deprivation ( Fig. 5 A ) . This result indicates that either Edc3p or the prionlike domain of Lsm4p is sufficient for P-body aggregation during glucose deprivation . It should be noted that small Dcp2GFP foci were occasionally observed in the GENE1 GENE2 strain , indicating that microscopically visible P-bodies can assemble , though inefficiently , in the absence of both Edc3p and the C terminus of Lsm4p . Nevertheless , the severe defect in P-body formation in the GENE1 GENE2 mutant identifies the Q/N-rich domain of Lsm4p as a second protein domain that can affect the formation of microscopically visible P-bodies .
In the absence of GENE1 , the prionlike domain of GENE2 is required for P-body aggregation , but not for translation repression , in response to glucose deprivation . ( A ) Localization of Dcp2GFP in wild-type , edc3Delta , lsm4DeltaC ( deletion of C terminus of Lsm4 including the Q/N-rich prionlike domain ) , or lsm4DeltaC edc3Delta strains , or an lsm4Delta edc3Delta strain carrying a plasmid in which the C-terminal Q/N-rich domain of GENE2 has been replaced with the prion domain of Rnq1p during exponential growth in YP containing glucose ( + glu ) or after being deprived of glucose for 10 min while being aerated ( -glu ) . ( B ) Localization of MFA2P-U1A mRNA in wild-type or lsm4DeltaC edc3Delta strains deprived of glucose for 10 min while being aerated . The MFA2P-U1A mRNA was detected by coexpressing U1A fused with GFP , which binds to the U1A binding sites within the 3 ' UTR of the mRNA . Note that a different contrast range was used than the range in A because of the intense fluorescence signal of the RNA foci in the wild-type cells . Bars , 3 mum . ( C ) Polysome profiles , A254 traces of sucrose density gradients , obtained from wild-type or lsm4DeltaC edc3Delta strains grown under standard growth conditions ( + glu ) or deprived of glucose for 10 min while being aerated ( -glu ) .
Because Dcp2GFP was used as a marker for P-bodies , it was formally possible that the Q/N-rich domain of Lsm4p was solely required for the localization of Dcp2p to P-bodies in the absence of Edc3p . To verify that the GENE1 GENE2 deletion mutant was defective for P-body formation , we examined the localization of the reporter mRNA MFA2P-U1A , which contains binding sites for the U1A protein by coexpressing U1A protein fused to GFP . This reporter mRNA accumulates in P-bodies after glucose deprivation ( Brengues et al. , 2005 ) . As shown in Fig. 5 B , the GENE1 GENE2 mutant has a severe defect in the accumulation of the MFA2P-U1A reporter mRNA in response to glucose deprivation . This observation supports the interpretation that both the Q/N-rich domains of Lsm4p and Edc3p contribute to P-body formation .
To test whether P-body aggregation by Edc3p enhances decapping , we examined the ability of the different domain deletion mutants of Edc3p to complement the OTHER_GENE decapping defect seen in GENE1 - 7 strains . As observed previously , OTHER_GENE exacerbates a partial defect in the decay of the MFA2pG mRNA at a low temperature caused by the temperature-sensitive allele GENE1 - 7 ( Fig. 6 B ) . Deletion of OTHER_GENE also slows growth in GENE1 - 7 GENE2 cells ( Kshirsagar and Parker , 2004 ) , in which 3'-to-5 ' mRNA decay is inactive and decapping is partially defective because of the growth temperature ( Fig. 6 C ) . An important result is that the Yjef-N deletion mutant complemented both the decay and growth defects caused by the absence of Edc3p ( Fig. 6 , B and C ) . Because the Yjef-N domain is necessary for P-body aggregation in exponentially growing cells , these results indicate that Edc3p 's role in enhancing decay under these conditions is not dependent on its ability to form large P-body aggregates . In contrast , decay and growth were defective when either the DeltaLsm or DeltaFDF Edc3p variants were expressed ( Fig. 6 , B and C ) , which indicates that both the Lsm and FDF domains are necessary for Edc3p to enhance decapping . Because these are the domains that interact with Dcp2p and Dhh1p , this result suggests that Edc3p may enhance decapping by binding to and directly affecting the function of the decapping machinery .

Several observations argue that Edc3p functions to aggregate either individual mRNPs or small mRNP complexes into larger microscopically visible P-bodies . First , strains lacking Edc3p show a loss of the small P-bodies seen in mid-log cultures of yeast ( Figs. 1 A and 2 ) . Second , the number and size of P-bodies seen in either OTHER_GENE or OTHER_GENE strains are reduced in OTHER_GENE GENE1 or OTHER_GENE GENE1 double mutants ( Fig. 1 B ) . Third , GENE1 cells show defects in P-body aggregation during glucose deprivation and other stresses ( Figs. 1 A and 2 and not depicted ) . Fourth , there is a loss of P-bodies in GENE2 GENE1 strains during glucose deprivation ( Fig. 5 ) . Finally , we argue that Edc3p plays a role in the actual assembly of nontranslating mRNPs into larger visible structures because translation repression and mRNA decay are normal in GENE1 strains ( Figs. 2 and 6 ) .

We identified the C-terminal prionlike domain of Lsm4p as another mechanism for the aggregation of mRNPs into microscopically visible P-bodies . The key observation is that GENE1 GENE2 strains show a dramatic reduction in P-bodies during glucose deprivation compared with GENE2 strains alone ( Fig. 5 ) . In addition , the C-terminal Q/N-rich domain of Lsm4p could be functionally replaced with the Q/N-rich prionlike domain of Rnq1p , a known yeast prion protein ( Fig. 5 ) . The simplest model is that when the Lsm1 - 7p complex is delivered to the mRNA in conjunction with Pat1p ( Teixeira and Parker , 2007 ) , the Q/N-rich domain interacts either with itself or other Q/N-rich domains to aggregate mRNPs together in a manner similar to oligomerization of other prion domains , although in this case the aggregation would be readily reversible and not necessarily heritable .
Our results argue that formation of microscopically visible P-bodies is not required for the basal control of translation and mRNA degradation . The key observation is that GENE1 GENE2 strains are severely defective in P-body aggregation ( Fig. 5 ) but competent for translation repression during glucose deprivation and show normal mRNA turnover rates ( Figs. 5 and 6 ) . The simplest interpretation is that the association of P-body components with an individual mRNA is sufficient for a basal level of translation repression and/or decapping . However , we can not rule out the possibility that , in the absence of Edc3p and the prionlike domain of Lsm4p , aggregates too small to detect by the light microscope but nonetheless functional can still form . Consistent with the interpretation that large-scale aggregates do not strongly influence translation repression or mRNA turnover , microscopically visible P-bodies can be depleted in metazoan cells by knockdown of Lsm1p or Lsm3p without affecting miRNA-mediated repression ( Chu and Rana , 2006 ; Eulalio et al. , 2007b ) , knockdown of GW182 without affecting mRNA decay stimulated by AU-rich elements ( Stoecklin et al. , 2006 ) , or knockdown of any one of several P-body components without affecting nonsense mediated decay ( Eulalio et al. , 2007b ) .
Because biochemical studies indicate that HMO1 does not interact directly with TAND ( Figure 1 ) , we examined whether there is a genetic interaction between these two factors . On rich medium , we compared the growth properties of wild-type , single ( GENE1 , GENE2 ) and double ( GENE1 GENE2 ) deletion mutants ( Figure 2A ) . Previous studies demonstrated that GENE1 strains exhibit slower growth rates than wild-type strains over a wide range of temperatures ( 21,57 ) . In contrast , our GENE1 strain demonstrated a cold-sensitive growth phenotype ( Figure 2A ) , presumably due to its specific genetic background . A slight ( but reproducible ) decrease in growth rate was observed when GENE1 was combined with GENE2 [ i.e. TAND1 + 2 ( Delta2 - 86 ) or TAND1 + 2 + 3 ( Delta2 - 186 ) ] ( Figure 2A ) .
When an GENE1 expression plasmid was transfected into wild-type and GENE2 strains , the number of transformants appeared to be significantly lower in GENE2 ( 10 - 73 aa ) than in the wild-type strain ( Figure 2B ) , due to delayed rates of colony formation in the former strain . This strain-specific toxicity was also HMO1-specific , because it was not observed with empty vector ( * ) , or with a plasmid overexpressing an unrelated protein ( VTC1 ) . GENE1 was also overexpressed in wild-type and GENE2 mutant strains [ TAND1 ( 8 - 42 aa ) , TAND2 ( 41 - 73 aa ) or both ( 10 - 73 aa ) ] from the TEF1 and TDH3 promoters . The results confirmed that GENE1 overexpression is toxic to cells that are deficient in TAND1 ( Figure 2C ) . One interpretation of these data is that GENE1 and TAND1 perform antagonistic roles in regulating TBP . These genetic data support the hypothesis that GENE1 is involved in transcription of class II genes via its interaction with TBP/TAND1/TFIID .
The role of OTHER_GENE in transcription of the inducible GENE1 gene was also investigated . Here , expression was measured as a function of time after shift from raffinose to galactose-containing medium in wild-type , and in single ( Deltahmo1 , taf1DeltaTAND ) or double ( Deltahmo1 taf1DeltaTAND ) deletion mutant strains ( Figure 3B ) . Deficiency in OTHER_GENE ( Deltahmo1 ) caused a decrease ( or delay ) in expression of GENE1 . Deficiency in TAND had a similar but more severe effect , and the effects of these two mutations were additive . These results indicate that OTHER_GENE and TAND function together in GENE1 transcription . Significantly , mutations in OTHER_GENE and TAND also had additive effects on transcription of OTHER_GENE and GENE2 ( Figure 3A ) . Collectively , these data indicate that OTHER_GENE and TAND may regulate transcription of distinct subsets of TFIID-dependent genes in antagonistic or cooperative manners .

The results described above showed that GENE1 reduces the growth of some OTHER_GENE and OTHER_GENE mutants ( Figure 5A and C ) , while it restores the growth of some GENE2 mutants ( Figure 5B ) . Thus , we asked whether the effect of GENE1 on transcription of class II genes is consistent with these growth phenotypes . Indeed , GENE1 impairs transcription of some genes in the OTHER_GENE and OTHER_GENE mutants whereas it restores transcription in the GENE2 mutants .

Northern blot analysis was conducted for the strains described above ( Figure 5 ) . The results show that GENE1 significantly reduced the expression of OTHER_GENE at 25 C and 37 C in the spt15-E236P and -K239L mutants ( Supplementary Figure 1A ) . A similar but weaker effect of GENE1 was observed in the spt15-F237D and -N159L mutants ( Supplementary Figure 1A ) . In contrast , the spt15-K138T/Y139A mutation almost completely abolished OTHER_GENE expression at both temperatures even in the HMO1 strain ( Supplementary Figure 1A ) . Such a detrimental effect of GENE1 in the GENE2 mutants seems to be specific for a subset of genes since it was observed for OTHER_GENE but not for TEF2 ( Supplementary Figure 1A ) , even though HMO1 binds to both promoters at similar levels ( 23 ) . These results indicate that HMO1 plays different roles in transcription at different promoters .

Consistent with the growth phenotypes , GENE1 restored the expression of RPS5 at 25 C and 37 C in the sua7-K190E and -K201E mutants ( Supplementary Figure 1B ) . A similar but much weaker effect of GENE1 was observed in the sua7-E62 K and -R78C mutants ( Supplementary Figure 1B ) . Furthermore , GENE1 restored the expression of OTHER_GENE in the sua7-K190E ( 37 C ) , -K201E ( 37 C ) , -E62 K ( 25/37 C ) and -R78C ( 25/37 C ) mutants ( Supplementary Figure 1B ) . GENE1 also restored the expression of GENE2 in the sua7-K190E and -K201E mutants ( 25/37 C ) ( Supplementary Figure 1B ) . Previous studies have shown that the sua7-K190E and -K201E mutations are defective in forming a stable TFIIB-TBP-DNA complex while sua7-E62 K and -R78C mutations shift the transcriptional start site downstream ( 64,65 ) . Therefore , these results indicate that HMO1 could restore a range of transcriptional defects caused by different types of OTHER_GENE mutations .

Finally , northern blot analyses showed that GENE1 significantly reduced expression of GENE2 ( 25/37 C ) and RPS5/TEF2 ( 25/37 C ) in the toa1-Delta(55 - 215 ) and toa1-W285A mutants , respectively ( Supplementary Figure 1B ) .
GENE1 caused growth defects in some , but not all , of the GENE2 mutants that are lethal with OTHER_GENE . For instance , the GENE2 mutations N159D , V161A and S118L have growth defects in combination with OTHER_GENE ( 39 ) , but not with GENE1 ( Figure 5A ) . These observations indicate that HMO1 and TAND have both shared and unique functional roles , which is consistent with the observation that the synthetic defect between OTHER_GENE and GENE1 is relatively weak ( Figure 2A ) .

The questions we have asked are , Why does the cell express two actin bundling activities that both function within the cortical patch , and also , Does deletion of GENE1 cause any detectable endocytic phenotype ? GFP-Abp1 was used as a functional marker of actin patches forming during the endocytic process and was analyzed in wild type , Deltasac6 , Deltascp1 , and Deltascp1Deltasac6 cells . Kymographs showing the behavior of representative patches are shown in Fig. 5A . The lifetime of the patches were also quantified ( Fig. 5B ) . Deletion of either GENE2 or GENE1 increases patch lifetime from 17.9 to 23.4 or 24.7 s , respectively . The double deletion showed an even more dramatic increase in lifetime to 35.8 s.
Nuclear mRNA export is a crucial step in eukaryotic gene expression , which is in yeast coupled to cotranscriptional messenger ribonucleoprotein particle ( mRNP ) assembly and surveillance . Several surveillance systems that monitor nuclear mRNP biogenesis and export have been described , but the mechanism by which the improper mRNPs are recognized and eliminated remains poorly understood . Here we report that the conserved PIN domain protein GENE1 is an RNA endonuclease that participates in quality control of nuclear mRNPs and can associate with the nuclear pore complex ( NPC ) . GENE1 showed endoribonuclease activity in vitro that was inhibited by a point mutation in the predicted catalytic site . GENE1 lacked clear sequence specificity but showed a strong preference for single-stranded regions . Genetic interactions were found between GENE1 and the THO/TREX and TREX-2 complexes , and with components of the perinuclear mRNP surveillance system , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , and OTHER_GENE . Inhibition of the nuclease activity of GENE1 increased the levels and cytoplasmic leakage of unspliced aberrant pre-mRNA , and induced robust nuclear poly(A)+ RNA accumulation in OTHER_GENE and GENE2 strains . Overexpression of GENE1 also caused strong nuclear poly(A)+ RNA accumulation . GENE1 is normally distributed throughout the nucleus and cytoplasm but becomes concentrated at nuclear pore complexes ( NPCs ) in the nup133Delta mutant , which causes NPC clustering and defects in mRNP export . The data suggest that GENE1 endoribonuclease might be transiently recruited to NPCs to initiate the degradation of defective pre-mRNPs or mRNPs trapped at nuclear periphery in order to avoid their cytoplasmic export and translation .

Nuclear mRNA export is a crucial step in eukaryotic gene expression , which is in yeast coupled to cotranscriptional messenger ribonucleoprotein particle ( mRNP ) assembly and surveillance . Several surveillance systems that monitor nuclear mRNP biogenesis and export have been described , but the mechanism by which the improper mRNPs are recognized and eliminated remains poorly understood . Here we report that the conserved PIN domain protein OTHER_GENE is an RNA endonuclease that participates in quality control of nuclear mRNPs and can associate with the nuclear pore complex ( NPC ) . OTHER_GENE showed endoribonuclease activity in vitro that was inhibited by a point mutation in the predicted catalytic site . OTHER_GENE lacked clear sequence specificity but showed a strong preference for single-stranded regions . Genetic interactions were found between OTHER_GENE and the THO/TREX and TREX-2 complexes , and with components of the perinuclear mRNP surveillance system , GENE1 , OTHER_GENE , and OTHER_GENE . Inhibition of the nuclease activity of OTHER_GENE increased the levels and cytoplasmic leakage of unspliced aberrant pre-mRNA , and induced robust nuclear poly(A)+ RNA accumulation in OTHER_GENE and GENE2 strains . Overexpression of OTHER_GENE also caused strong nuclear poly(A)+ RNA accumulation .

To identify factors that interact with TREX-2 , a transcription-export complex , which functions at the inner side of the NPC , we performed a synthetic lethality ( sl ) screen with the GENE1 strain . Among the candidates , we identified a mutant allele of the SWT1/YOR166 gene . The genetic interaction was verified by absence of growth of a haploid GENE1 OTHER_GENE strain , generated by plasmid loss ( Figure S1 ) . Other TREX-2 components OTHER_GENE and OTHER_GENE were either sl ( thp1Delta ) or showed strong synergistic interaction ( sus1Delta ) with OTHER_GENE , demonstrating an intimate functional interaction between GENE2 and TREX-2 complex ( Table 1 and Figure S1 ) .

To assess whether the poly(A)+ RNA accumulation reflects the accumulation of nuclear mRNA , we tested a specific transcript , the heat-shock SSA1 mRNA ( Figure 2A ) . This mRNA was clearly accumulated in the nucleus of the GENE1 GENE2 double mutant , but not in the corresponding single mutants . In contrast , no nuclear accumulation was observed when the nuclear export of tRNA was assayed ( unpublished data ) . To quantify whether the levels of SSA1 transcript were increased in the OTHER_GENE GENE2 double mutant , we measured the amount of SSA1 mRNA before and after heat shock by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) . The SSA1 levels were mildly increased in the single mutants , but a synergistic increase was observed in the OTHER_GENE GENE2 double mutant in comparison to wild-type strain ( Figure S4 ) .

To test whether the double mutants of GENE1 and OTHER_GENE or GENE2 result in synergistic defects in pre-mRNP surveillance , we monitored cytoplasmic leakage of unspliced pre-mRNA reporters [ 11,12,14 ] . No leakage of the reporter with intact splicing signals ( pJCR1 ) was observed in the GENE1 strain , whereas the GENE2 strain showed increased leakage of the unspliced pre-mRNA , which was synergistically enhanced in the GENE1 GENE2 double mutant ( Figure 2B ) . Next , we tested whether pre-mRNA reporters with a mutation in the 5 ' splicing site ( mut5'SS ) or in the branch-point site ( mutBP ) exhibit an increased cytoplasmic leakage in GENE1 cells . Notably , leakage of the mutBP reporter was increased approximately 4-fold in the GENE1 or OTHER_GENE single mutants relative the wild type ( Figure 2B ; see also [ 14,16 ] ) . Cytoplasmic leakage of both mutant pre-mRNA reporters was again strongly synergistically enhanced in the GENE1 OTHER_GENE double mutant ( Figure 2B ) .

To further explore the relationship of Ubp2 and OTHER_GENE to Rsp5-related functions , we examined the effects of inducible ectopic overexpression of either Ubp2 or OTHER_GENE in a strain harbouring a temperature-sensitive hypomorphic allele of RSP5 ( GENE1 - 1 ) [ 34 ] , as well as in a wild-type strain , looking for enhancement or suppression of the conditional slow-growth phenotype . As seen in the limiting dilution series shown in Figure 2A , Ubp2 overexpression was moderately toxic to the control strain as compared to an empty control vector , while the GENE1 - 1 mutant was found to be extremely hypersensitive . This synthetic dosage lethality was specific to OTHER_GENE , as the GENE1 - 1 strain did not shown any hypersensitivity to overexpression of two other unrelated deubiquitinating enzymes , UBP6 and UBP10 ( Figure 2A ) . Indeed , although overproduction of UBP10 caused a noticeable growth defect in wildtype cells , this defect did not worsen when combined with the GENE1 - 1 mutation , in striking contrast to OTHER_GENE . While wildtype yeast were not detectably sensitive to the overexpression of OTHER_GENE , GENE1 - 1 and OTHER_GENE mutants displayed modest hypersensitivity . On the other hand , a deletion of GENE2 resulted in a reduction in the growth impairment caused by the overexpression of OTHER_GENE . These data support the notion that OTHER_GENE functions coordinately with , but not equivalently to Ubp2 . To confirm that these genetic interactions were not specific to the GENE1 - 1 allele , another allele , GENE1 - 326 [ 35 ] was tested ( Figure 2B ) . All of the above interactions were similar in this mutant background . When Rsp5 was expressed from a low copy number plasmid , pHA-RSP5 [ 36 ] , in GENE1 - 326 strains , the growth phenotypes seen were rescued to wildtype levels , indicating that these phenotypes were specific to RSP5 .

Consistent with this apparent functional antagonism ( Figure 2A ; [ 23 ] ) , deletion of the GENE1 open reading frame partially rescued the temperature-sensitivity of an GENE2 - 1 mutant strain ( Figure 2C ) , although deletion of RUP1 had no observable affect . Taken together , these results are consistent with a recently proposed model [ 23 ] wherein Ubp2 directly antagonizes Rsp5 activity , and imply that Rup1 likely serves as a less critical ancillary role such as facilitating the interaction of Ubp2 with Rsp5 or possible substrates .
A key characteristic of Ubps is the presence of an evolutionarily conserved catalytic domain [ 15 ] . To test whether the catalytic activity of Ubp2 was necessary for the antagonistic interaction observed with Rsp5-deficient strains , we mutated cysteine 745 , a critical residue of the core Cys box motif conserved across all members of the Ubp family , to serine , which is predicted to result in a severe or complete loss of deubiquitinating capacity [ 19 ] , [ 37 ] . As expected , we observed that overexpression of this putatively inactive mutant , OTHER_GENE C745S , led to a marked reduction in the slow-growth phenotype caused by overexpression of GENE1 in either GENE2 strain background ( Figure 2 , B and D ) , suggesting that inappropriate or excessive deubiquitination activity is largely , but not exclusively , responsible for the functional antagonism observed .

As expected , we observed that overexpression of this putatively inactive mutant , GENE1 C745S , led to a marked reduction in the slow-growth phenotype caused by overexpression of GENE2 in either OTHER_GENE strain background ( Figure 2 , B and D ) , suggesting that inappropriate or excessive deubiquitination activity is largely , but not exclusively , responsible for the functional antagonism observed .

We recently reported that the RAD18 and RAD6 genes are important components of the cellular network that prevents 8-oxoG-induced mutagenesis in Ogg1-deficient strains of S. cerevisiae ( 28 ) . The Rad18-Rad6 complex possesses an ubiquitin-conjugating activity that catalyzes the monoubiquitylation of PCNA at lysine K164 , which is required for all branches of the post-replication repair process ( 29,30,43,44 ) . Here , we investigated the impact of the K164R mutation of PCNA ( POL30 gene product ) that abolishes the conjugation of ubiquitin to PCNA and greatly reduces that of SUMO ( 29,30,43,44 ) . The results show that the GENE1 pol30-K164R double mutant , like GENE1 GENE2 and GENE1 OTHER_GENE , exhibits a synergistic increase in CanR mutation rate compared to that of the single mutants ( Table 2 ) . In contrast , the GENE1 rad5 and GENE1 siz1 double mutants do not exhibit a synergistic increase in CanR mutation rates compared to that of the single mutants ( Table 2 ) . These results suggest that neither Rad5-dependent polyubiquitylation nor Siz1-dependent sumoylation of PCNA is involved in the prevention of 8-oxoG-induced mutagenesis in Ogg1-deficient cells . Table 2 also shows that homologous recombination does not play a critical role in the antimutagenic process at 8-oxoG , since the spontaneous mutation rate in the GENE1 rad51 double mutant corresponds to the sum of the rates in the two single mutants . These results are in agreement with the notion that only monoubiquitylation of PCNA ( PCNA-Ub1 ) at K164 plays an important role in the process that prevents high spontaneous mutation rates in S. cerevisiae .

Table 4 shows that GENE1 has no significant effect on the overall CanR mutation rate in WT , OTHER_GENE or pol30-K164R strains . Although biased in favor of GC to TA , the spontaneous mutator phenotype of OTHER_GENE is most likely not due to 8-oxoG but to other endogenous DNA damage(s ) or structure(s ) ( 28,45 ) . In contrast , the GENE1 protein greatly reduces spontaneous CanR mutation rate in the GENE2 single mutant , which is expected if CanR mutations are due to 8-oxoG ( Table 4 ) . Table 4 also shows that the expression of GENE1 only partially suppresses spontaneous mutagenesis ( to the OTHER_GENE level ) in the GENE2 OTHER_GENE double mutant , which confirms the impact of another class of damage at the origin of mutations in Rad18-deficient cells . Finally , the expression of GENE1 completely suppresses ( to the WT level ) spontaneous mutagenesis in the GENE2 pol30-K164R double mutant ( Table 4 ) . Therefore , both the mutation spectrum and the suppression of the mutator phenotype by GENE1 point to 8-oxoG as the major cause of mutations in the GENE2 pol30-K164R double mutant .

Our model suggests a competition between DNA polymerases delta ( Pol delta ) and eta to bind PCNA or PCNA-Ub1 during the gap-filling reaction after the MMR-dependent excision of A.8-oxoG mismatches ( 28 ) . The role of Pol delta can not be directly addressed because of its essential function in S. cerevisiae . However , one of the three subunits of Pol delta , Pol32 , is non-essential and can be deleted ( 49,50 ) . We therefore investigated the impact of the Pol32 protein on spontaneous CanR mutation rate in GENE1 and GENE1 GENE2 backgrounds . Table 5 shows that the GENE1 OTHER_GENE double mutant does not exhibit an enhanced CanR spontaneous mutation rate , compared to an GENE1 single mutant . Interestingly , the CanR mutation rate is greatly reduced in the GENE1 GENE2 OTHER_GENE triple mutant compared to the GENE1 GENE2 double mutant ( Table 5 ) . We propose that in the absence of PCNA-Ub1 in the GENE1 GENE2 strain , both Pol delta and Pol eta are recruited at unmodified PCNA allowing significant dAMP incorporation opposite to 8-oxoG , which explains the enhanced mutagenesis in the GENE1 GENE2 strain . In the GENE1 GENE2 OTHER_GENE triple mutant , the recruitment of Pol eta at unmodified PCNA could be favored because of the loss of affinity of Pol delta for PCNA in absence of its Pol32 subunit , which also possesses a PIP domain ( 50 ) . Consequently , the shift in favor of Pol eta would promote dCMP incorporation and explain the reduced CanR mutation rate in the GENE1 GENE2 OTHER_GENE triple mutant .

Expression of exogenous GENE1 in ALT cells can induce telomerase activity , but does not abolish the ALT mechanism20,21 , suggesting coexistence of ALT and telomerase in hTERT-transfected ALT cells . To investigate the relationship between GENE2 mediated-ALT cell proliferation and telomere maintenance , we stably expressed GENE1 in U2OS cells . Telomerase was activated in these cells , as detected by the telomerase TRAP assay ( Fig. 3A ) . The colony formation results showed that expression of GENE1 partially rescued the arrested cell growth upon depletion of GENE2 ( Fig. 3B ) . We also confirmed the results in another ALT cell line ( SAOS-2 ) . Expression of GENE1 in SAOS-2 rescued the cell growth arrest and about 70 % of the cells survived upon depletion of GENE2 . U2OS cells expressing telomerase still showed a high rate of T-SCE and knockdown of GENE2 decreased the T-SCE rate in these cells ( Fig. 3C ) , suggesting that rescue of MUS81-mediated ALT cell survival by telomerase is independent of the telomere recombination pathway . Thus , the results support that GENE2 regulates the growth of ALT cells mainly through maintenance of telomere by recombination .
Expression of GENE1 rescues the GENE2 depletion-mediated cell growth arrest in ALT cells . A. GENE1 was stably expressed in U2OS cells and the TRAP assay was performed to evaluate the telomerase activity . Heated U2OS cell lysates and lysates from primary fibroblasts IMR90 were used as negative controls . Lysates from HT1080 cells were used as a positive control . B. U2OS cells with or without stably expressing GENE1 were transduced with shMUS81-A , shMUS81-B or empty vector for colony formation assays . After two weeks with drug-selection , cell colonies were counted and depletion of GENE2 was determined by WB analysis ( Supplementary Information Fig. S9 , Full scans ) . Quantitative analysis represents three independent experiments ( mean + - S.D. ) . The P value between U2OS and U2OS+hTERT groups with expression of MUS81-shRNAs was < 0.001 . P values were determined by Student 's t test . C. U2OS cells with or without stably expressing GENE1 were transduced with shMUS81-A , shMUS81-B or empty vector for T-SCE assays . Quantitative analysis represents three independent experiments ( mean + - S.D. ) .
Given that Mpk1 is the end kinase in the Pkc1-MAPK pathway , the above observations also raised the possibility that Mpk1 may phosphorylate OTHER_GENE directly . To confirm the notion , we first determined whether overproduction of GENE1 was able to cause OTHER_GENE phosphorylation . GENE1 is an active mutant of Mkk1 , a MAPKK in yeast . When overexpressed , it activates Mpk1 independent of upstream signals of the Pkc1-MAPK pathway [ 30 ] . As shown in Fig. 2A , GENE1 overproduction induced OTHER_GENE phosphorylation in wild type cells but not in cells deleted of GENE2 . This finding suggests that MKK1S386P promotes OTHER_GENE phosphorylation through Mpk1 . The Mpk1 dependent phosphorylation was also observed in cells deleted of both WSC1 and MID2 , indicating that these upstream activators of OTHER_GENE are not required for the phosphorylation . Similarly , deletion of PKC1 or BCK1 , which encode two upstream kinases of Mkk1 [ 9 ] , did not affect the phosphorylation , nor did the deletion of the gene for the transcription factor Rlm1 , a target of Mpk1 in transcription [ 30 ] . These findings demonstrate that activation of Mpk1 alone is sufficient for OTHER_GENE phosphorylation , supporting the notion that Mpk1 is directly involved in regulation of OTHER_GENE .

To further confirm that heat induced GENE1 relocation is caused by Mpk1 activation , we overexpressed OTHER_GENE in both wild type and GENE2 deletion cells . As shown in Fig. 3C , overexpression of OTHER_GENE caused redistribution of GENE1 in wild type cells but not in the mutant ones , suggesting that Mpk1 activation alone is sufficient for GENE1 redistribution .

The existence of the Mpk1-Rom2 feedback loop in the OTHER_GENE mediated Pkc1-MAPK pathway predicts that a sustained activation of Mpk1 would inhibit OTHER_GENE and Pkc1 dependent processes . Coincidently , it was previously shown that overexpression of the OTHER_GENE mutant inhibited cell growth through a Mpk1 dependent mechanism [ 30 ] . It is thus possible that the lethality associated with OTHER_GENE overproduction was caused by inhibition of OTHER_GENE through the Mpk1 dependent feedback loop . To test this possibility , we first determined whether expressing RHO1Q68H is able to rescue the OTHER_GENE induced growth arrest . We found that expressing the active but not wild type OTHER_GENE permitted cell growth in the presence of OTHER_GENE overproduction ( Fig. 6A ) , suggesting that the downregulation of OTHER_GENE is likely to be the cause for OTHER_GENE induced growth arrest . To further determine whether the Mpk1 mediated feedback loop is involved in the growth arrest , we examined the effect of OTHER_GENE overexpression in cells deleted of OTHER_GENE or GENE1 . As shown in Fig. 6B , whereas overexpression of OTHER_GENE inhibited the growth of wild type cells , it failed to do so to cells depleted of OTHER_GENE or GENE1 . This result suggests that the inhibitory effect of OTHER_GENE is mediated through the Mpk1 dependent feedback mechanism . Furthermore , we determined whether other components of the Rho1-mediated Pkc1-MAPK pathway are involved . Like wild type cells , those deleted of both WSC1 and MID2 , PKC1 , BCK1 , FKS1 and RLM1 remained sensitive to OTHER_GENE overexpression , suggesting these gene products are not required for the inhibitory activity of OTHER_GENE . Interestingly , deletion of GENE2 , which encodes a GEF of OTHER_GENE , rendered cells resistant to OTHER_GENE overexpression , while deletion of TUS1 , encoding another GEF of OTHER_GENE , did not .

As shown in Fig. 6B , whereas overexpression of OTHER_GENE inhibited the growth of wild type cells , it failed to do so to cells depleted of GENE2 or OTHER_GENE . This result suggests that the inhibitory effect of OTHER_GENE is mediated through the Mpk1 dependent feedback mechanism . Furthermore , we determined whether other components of the Rho1-mediated Pkc1-MAPK pathway are involved . Like wild type cells , those deleted of both WSC1 and MID2 , PKC1 , BCK1 , FKS1 and RLM1 remained sensitive to OTHER_GENE overexpression , suggesting these gene products are not required for the inhibitory activity of OTHER_GENE . Interestingly , deletion of OTHER_GENE , which encodes a GEF of GENE1 , rendered cells resistant to OTHER_GENE overexpression , while deletion of TUS1 , encoding another GEF of GENE1 , did not . This observation suggests that Rom1 , but not Tus1 , functions similarly to Rom2 in the feedback loop . Collectively , the above findings demonstrate that other components of the GENE1 mediated PKC1-MAPK pathway are not involved in the inhibitory feedback loop , further endorsing the notion that the loop constitutes a direct phosphorylation of Rom2 , and possibly , of Rom1 , by Mpk1 .
The existence of the Mpk1-Rom2 feedback loop in the OTHER_GENE mediated Pkc1-MAPK pathway predicts that a sustained activation of Mpk1 would inhibit OTHER_GENE and Pkc1 dependent processes . Coincidently , it was previously shown that overexpression of the GENE1 mutant inhibited cell growth through a Mpk1 dependent mechanism [ 30 ] . It is thus possible that the lethality associated with GENE1 overproduction was caused by inhibition of OTHER_GENE through the Mpk1 dependent feedback loop . To test this possibility , we first determined whether expressing RHO1Q68H is able to rescue the GENE1 induced growth arrest .

We next sought to identify the enzymes involved in ubiquitylating excess histones . Budding yeast has one E1 enzyme , Uba1 , which is required for all ubiquitylation and is essential for viability33 . There are thirteen E2 enzymes ( Ubc1 to Ubc13 ) , of which 11 are involved in ubiquitylation . Ubc9 is required for sumoylation and Ubc12 is needed for neddylation of proteins . We systematically screened strains carrying deletion or ts mutations of all the Ubc enzymes for sensitivity to histone H3 overexpression using a galactose inducible promoter , which identifies mutants defective in histone degradation by their poor growth on galactose media9 . We found that OTHER_GENE and OTHER_GENE deletion strains were sensitive to histone overexpression , though not as sensitive as OTHER_GENE mutants ( Figure 4A ) . GENE1 and GENE2 are 92 % identical at the protein sequence level and function redundantly in protein degradation34 . Hence , we constructed the OTHER_GENE OTHER_GENE double deletion strain , which proved as sensitive as OTHER_GENE mutants to histone overexpression ( Figure 4A ) , implying that both GENE1 and GENE2 contribute to excess histone degradation . The remaining ubc mutants , including ubc2 ( rad6 ) , the E2 required for monoubiquitylation of histone H2B in vivo35 , were insensitive to histone overexpression ( Supplemental Figure S4 ) , indicating that they are dispensable for histone degradation in vivo .

OTHER_GENE and GENE2 are 92 % identical at the protein sequence level and function redundantly in protein degradation34 . Hence , we constructed the OTHER_GENE GENE1 double deletion strain , which proved as sensitive as OTHER_GENE mutants to histone overexpression ( Figure 4A ) , implying that both OTHER_GENE and GENE2 contribute to excess histone degradation . The remaining ubc mutants , including ubc2 ( rad6 ) , the E2 required for monoubiquitylation of histone H2B in vivo35 , were insensitive to histone overexpression ( Supplemental Figure S4 ) , indicating that they are dispensable for histone degradation in vivo .
( A ) Yeast strains lacking OTHER_GENE , GENE1 and GENE2 are sensitive to histone overexpression . Wild type W303 and congenic strains carrying deletions of genes encoding E2 or E3 enzymes were transformed with either a plasmid encoding galactose inducible , HIS10-TEV-HA ( HTH ) tagged histone H3 ( pYES2-HTH-HHT2 ) or the empty vector (pYES2-HTH)9 . The resulting transformants were grown overnight in minimal medium lacking uracil ( to select for the plasmids ) and containing 2 % raffinose as carbon source . 10-fold serial dilutions of each strain were plated on minimal media minus uracil , with either glucose or galactose as carbon source . The plates were incubated for 3 days at 30 C , except for the slow growing ubc4 ubc5 double mutants which were incubated for 6 days . The rad53 deletion strain carries the sml1 - 1 null allele to suppress the lethality due to the loss of the essential function of Rad53 .

GENE1 is a high copy suppressor of GENE2
To better understand the function of OTHER_GENE , we screened for high copy suppressors of the GENE1 growth defect . OTHER_GENE was identified from this screen as a modest growth suppressor ( Fig. 2 A ) . High copy GENE2 , which encodes a protein identical to OTHER_GENE , was also a weak suppressor ( unpublished data ) . Because GENE1 cells exhibit defects not only in 60S biogenesis but also in other pathways ( Park et al. , 1996 ; Beeser and Cooper , 2000 ; Sakumoto et al. , 2001 ; Hanaoka et al. , 2005 ; Liu and Chang , 2009 ) , we asked whether OTHER_GENE specifically suppressed the defect in synthesis of large subunits . Extracts from GENE1 mutant cells with empty vector or high copy OTHER_GENE were analyzed on sucrose density gradients . Increasing the copy number of OTHER_GENE gave a modest improvement in polysomes but , surprisingly , reduced the levels of free 60S ( Fig. 2 B ) .

GENE1 is a high copy suppressor of GENE2 . ( A ) Serial dilutions of AJY2976 ( GENE2 ) with vector or pAJ2458 ( 2micro GENE1 ) were spotted onto URA dropout medium and incubated at 30 C for 2 d. ( B ) Extracts from AJY2976 ( GENE2 ) with vector or pAJ2458 were fractioned on sucrose gradients as described in Fig. 1 .
To test whether the 60S binding or the phosphatase activity of Yvh1 is required for GENE1 release , we monitored the GENE1 localization in the different yvh1 mutants . Although the localization of GENE1 was restored in OTHER_GENE and phosphatase mutants that complement the slow-growth phenotype of GENE2 ( Liu and Chang , 2009 ; data not shown ) , GENE1 remained in the cytoplasm in yvh1DeltaC cells ( Fig. 3 B ) . This result strongly connects the growth phenotype of GENE2 cells and GENE1 mislocalization . The slow-growth defect of GENE2 may arise from a failure to recycle GENE1 to the nucleus to support pre-60S assembly , a failure to release GENE1 and load P0 , or both ( see Fig. 4 and Discussion ) .

If the persistence of Mrt4 on the subunit is responsible for the slow growth of GENE1 cells , elimination of Mrt4 may alleviate the problem . As seen in Fig. 4 A , the mrt4Delta and GENE1 single mutants were almost indistinguishable from the mrt4Delta GENE1 double mutant in growth rate , indicating an epistatic relationship between mrt4Delta and GENE1 . Deletion of GENE2 did not improve the growth defect of the GENE1 mutant , probably because deletion of GENE2 itself results in a growth defect comparable to deletion of YVH1 . We also tested the effect of increasing the levels of Mrt4 in GENE1 cells , reasoning that overexpressing Mrt4 could restore the nuclear pool of Mrt4 to support 60S biogenesis . However , if Yvh1 were absolutely required for release of Mrt4 , increasing Mrt4 levels would be expected to drive more Mrt4 onto nascent subunits . Without a mechanism for its release , this could be deleterious in a yvh1 mutant . In fact , overexpression of GENE2 strongly inhibited cell growth in GENE1 cells ( Fig. 4 B ) but not wild type ( not depicted ) .
Mutant GENE1 containing a glycine to aspartate change at position 68 ( Mrt4-G68D ) was reported to be a dominant suppressor of the GENE2 growth defect ( Nugroho , S. , N. Sakumoto , and S. Harashima . 2003 . International Conference on Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology . Abstr . 10 - 42 ) , but a molecular understanding of the suppression was not known . We confirmed this suppression of GENE2 by Mrt4-G68D ( Fig. 5 A ) . To determine whether Mrt4-G68D suppresses the 60S ribosome biogenesis defects of GENE2 , we analyzed the polysome profile of GENE2 cells expressing Mrt4-G68D as the sole copy of MRT4 . Expression of Mrt4-G68D in GENE2 cells fully restored the polysome profile of GENE2 cells , reversing the free subunit imbalance and eliminating the halfmers evident in the yvh1 deletion mutant ( Fig. 5 B ) . Similarly , Mrt4-G68D reversed the rRNA-processing defects seen in GENE2 cells ( Fig. S1 ) . Suppression of GENE2 by a point mutation in GENE1 strongly argues that GENE1 is the target of Yvh1 . If Mrt4-G68D suppresses the defects of GENE2 cells , we would also expect Mrt4-G68D to localize to the nucleus in a GENE2 mutant . Indeed , Mrt4-G68D was predominantly nuclear in the absence of Yvh1 ( Fig. 5 C ) . Thus , this mutant GENE1 appears to bypass Yvh1 function while maintaining GENE1 function .
The DNA-damage-induced mobility shift of GENE1 is largely dependent on Mec1 ( 27 ) . A low level of shifted material remains in a OTHER_GENE deletion or kinase-deficient mec1-kd strain ( Figure 1D ) . We tested whether this residual phosphorylation depends on Tel1 , the second PIK-kinase in budding yeast . While a GENE2 single deletion mutation has no effect on Rad55-S378 phosphorylation ( Figure 1D , ( 27 ) ) , the residual Rad55-S378 phosphorylation in the mec1-Delta mutant strains appears completely eliminated in the OTHER_GENE GENE2 double mutant . This suggests that Tel1 can phosphorylate GENE1 in an S378-dependent manner , albeit making a minor contribution even in mec1-Delta cells .

Next we wanted to address the underlying defect in proteasome function that results in CIN . First we examined the proteasomal CIN mutants for sensitivity to Bleomycin ( bleo ) [ 21 ] , and to hydroxyurea (HU)[22 ] . Mutants involved in DSB repair are usually sensitive to both drugs [23],[24 ] . We show that at semi-restrictive temperatures all proteasome mutants display varying degrees of sensitivity to these drugs ( Figure 3A and Figure S1B ) . These results support a previous study showing that other proteasome mutants show sensitivity to DNA damaging agents [ 7 ] . Moreover , Ts alleles of GENE1 and GENE2 , display a synthetic growth defect when either one is combined with OTHER_GENE , a key factor in the DSB repair pathway [ 25 ] ( for details see Figure 3B ) .

Different factors contribute to the assembly of P-bodies under glucose deprivation . The general decapping activators Dhh1 , OTHER_GENE and GENE1 have different roles in P-body assembly and composition [ 21 ] . Since absence of GENE1 or OTHER_GENE is synthetic lethal with GENE2 , we checked for the contribution of these factors to Sus1 presence at cytoplasmic granules . Cells lacking either LSM1 or PAT1 were transformed with pGFP-SUS1cDNA and pDcp2-RFP ; and localisation analysis of both proteins by fluorescence microscopy was performed . As shown in Figure 3B , Sus1 and Dcp2 still co-localise in these mutant backgrounds . Therefore , we conclude that Sus1 co-localises with P-bodies independently of GENE1 and OTHER_GENE . To analyze whether Sus1 might have a role in the assembly of cytoplasmic structures as P-bodies or stress granules , we localized Dcp2 or Pab1 in GENE2 cells . As illustrated in Figure 3C Sus1 is dispensable for the formation of P-body and stress granule . Thus , we conclude that Sus1 appears not to be a structural component of P-bodies or stress granules .

Since absence of GENE2 or GENE1 is synthetic lethal with OTHER_GENE , we checked for the contribution of these factors to Sus1 presence at cytoplasmic granules . Cells lacking either LSM1 or PAT1 were transformed with pGFP-SUS1cDNA and pDcp2-RFP ; and localisation analysis of both proteins by fluorescence microscopy was performed . As shown in Figure 3B , Sus1 and Dcp2 still co-localise in these mutant backgrounds . Therefore , we conclude that Sus1 co-localises with P-bodies independently of GENE2 and GENE1 . To analyze whether Sus1 might have a role in the assembly of cytoplasmic structures as P-bodies or stress granules , we localized Dcp2 or Pab1 in OTHER_GENE cells . As illustrated in Figure 3C Sus1 is dispensable for the formation of P-body and stress granule . Thus , we conclude that Sus1 appears not to be a structural component of P-bodies or stress granules .
Sus1 is genetically linked to proteins involved in different stages of gene expression . Previously , we reported that Sus1 deletion is synthetic lethal with deletions in mRNA export/biogenesis factors , namely Mex67 , Yra1 , Dbp5 , Nab2 and Sub2 [ 12 ] . In this study we show strong genetic interactions between OTHER_GENE and OTHER_GENE or OTHER_GENE ( synthetic lethality ) , and GENE1 or GENE2 ( synthetic enhancement ) . Lsm1 , Lsm6 , Pat1 and Dhh1 are proteins involved in mRNA degradation that are localised at cytoplasmic P-bodies [ 21 ] . Thus these new genetic interactions between Sus1 and these factors suggest a connection between Sus1 and cytoplasmic mRNA metabolism .

Despite their disparate proposed functions , GENE1 and GENE2 share a homology domain and have a similar domain arrangement ( Fig. 1 A ) . Starting from the surprising observation that these chaperones exhibit an aggravating genetic interaction , in this study , we uncover that these chaperones assist ribosome biogenesis , a highly ordered and regulated ribonucleoprotein assembly process that begins in the nucleolus and proceeds through nuclear and cytoplasmic steps ( for reviews see Tschochner and Hurt , 2003 ; Strunk and Karbstein , 2009 ) . GENE2 and GENE1 are required to assist nuclear steps of ribosome biogenesis , a process hitherto not shown to require chaperone assistance . Both J domain proteins cooperate with Hsp70-type CLIPS in a chaperone network that binds to nuclear ribosomal biogenesis intermediates and facilitates distinct steps in the ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) maturation pathway . Our results uncover a novel function for CLIPS chaperones and indicate that eukaryotes use two distinct ribosome-anchored J domain proteins to link chaperones to the ribosome assembly process .
Although RAC and GENE1 overlap functionally , these chaperones are not fully interchangeable . GENE2 , Deltassz1 , and Deltassb1/2 cells are hypersensitive to hygromycin , whereas Deltajjj1 cells are not ( Fig. S2 C ; Albanese et al. , 2006 ) . In addition , Zuo1 overexpression could not rescue the Deltajjj1 phenotype ( Fig. S2 C ; Meyer et al. , 2007 ) . Interestingly , although overexpression of GENE1 could rescue the slow growth of GENE2 cells ( Fig. S2 C ) , it could not suppress their hygromycin sensitivity phenotype ( Fig. 1 C ) . Thus , GENE1 and the RAC-SSB CLIPS have overlapping but distinct functions in a common pathway essential for cell survival .

We next examined the GENE1 domains required to rescue the growth defect of GENE2 cells ( Fig. 5 E ) . Inactivation of the J domain or deletion of the ZHD in GENE1 abolished the rescue of GENE2 slow growth ( Fig. 5 E , JJJ1-Jm and JJJ1-DeltaZHD ) . In contrast , JJJ1-DeltaC restored the normal growth of GENE2 cells ( Fig. 5 E , JJJ1-DeltaC ) . Thus , the nuclear Jjj1-DeltaC variant contains the region that overlaps functionally with Zuo1 . Because Zuo1 regulates the activity of SSB , which also appears important for ribosome biogenesis , we next examined whether GENE1 or its variants interact genetically with SSB ( Fig. 5 F ) . Remarkably , GENE1 overexpression fully restored the slow growth phenotype of OTHER_GENE ( Fig. 5 F ) . Similar to GENE2 cells , the growth phenotype of OTHER_GENE was also fully restored by the nuclear Jjj1-DeltaC variant ( Fig. 5 F ) . In sum , the predominantly nuclear GENE1 variant that does not interact with Rei1 can nonetheless rescue the Deltajjj1 , GENE2 , and OTHER_GENE growth phenotypes . Collectively , our results suggest that the functional overlap between GENE1 and the RAC-SSB chaperone system likely involves nuclear steps of ribosome biogenesis .

The synthetic aggravating interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 suggested that both chaperones function in overlapping but different steps within the same process , ribosome biogenesis . Microarray-based analysis of the rRNA processing pathway revealed that Deltajjj1 , Deltazuo1 , and Deltassb1/2 cells exhibit blockage in overlapping nuclear steps in the rRNA processing pathway ( Fig. 7 ) . Given the complexity of the ribosome assembly pathway , further mechanistic work will be required to define the precise steps requiring chaperone assistance .
GENE1 must act transiently during ribosome biogenesis given the low abundance of this chaperone ( 2,300 copies per cell ; Huh et al. , 2003 ) . Although we do find a fraction of GENE1 associated with translating polysomes even under the low endogenous expression levels ( Fig. 4 ) , most of it must either be recycled to return to the nucleus or degraded in the cytoplasm ( Fig. 8) . Perhaps the previously described interaction with Rei1 and other cytoplasmic factors plays a role in these processes ( Demoinet et al. , 2007 ; Meyer et al. , 2007 ) . Although deletion of the Rei1 interaction domain did not affect the phenotypes examined in this study , GENE1 likely has additional functions in the cytoplasm ( Demoinet et al. , 2007 ; Meyer et al. , 2007 ) in addition to its function in nuclear ribosome biogenesis . In support of this idea , deletion of GENE2 alleviates the cold sensitivity of the GENE1 deletion ( Fig. S5 A ; Demoinet et al. , 2007 ; Meyer et al. , 2007 ) , although it does not rescue its aberrant polysome profile ( Fig. S5 B , note the presence of half-mers in polysome profiles ) .
Our identification of GENE1 and RAC-SSB as promoting ribosome biogenesis raises many questions regarding their mechanism of action . RNA folding and RNA chaperones operate through very different principles than protein folding and protein chaperones ( Russell , 2008 ) . Thus , it is unlikely that these CLIPS chaperones act by remodeling the rRNA structure ( Russell , 2008 ) . More likely , GENE1 and Zuo1 bind to specific locations within the ribosomal precursors and by virtue of the recruitment of the Hsp70s SSA or SSB serve to remodel the ribosome biogenesis intermediates , either by facilitating the ordered recruitment and/or the dissociation of ribosomal proteins or assembly factors . Another possible function for SSA and SSB is that of maintaining the highly unstructured ribosomal proteins , many of which can not fold until incorporated into the ribosome , in a conformation that can be assembled into ribosomal particles . However , our data suggest that the role of these Hsp70s may not be limited to this function because GENE1 , which does not bind nascent chains ( unpublished data ) , can suppress the slow growth phenotype of GENE2 . Furthermore , Zuo1 , Ssz1 , and GENE1 do not bind directly to nascent chains , and thus , it would be unlikely to bring them into the nucleus . Clearly , future studies are required to identify the targets and precise steps mediated by these chaperones . It will also be interesting to define their interplay with previously described ribosome assembly factors , which include AAA ATPases and prolyl isomerases , which may have protein-remodeling functions ( for review see Strunk and Karbstein , 2009 ) . The finding that chaperones involved in cytosolic nascent chain binding also assist early steps in nuclear ribosome biogenesis provides an intriguing mechanism to link the capacity for protein synthesis and that of protein folding .

Deleting GENE1 is sufficient to permit SPB separation in cells lacking functional GENE2
To determine if Sic1 is the only SCFCdc4 target important for SPB separation , we deleted SIC1 in a strain carrying a temperature-sensitive CDC4 allele , GENE1 - 3 [ 19 ] , [ 50 ] , [ 51 ] , and expressing GFP-tagged Spc42 , a SPB component . We then asked if the ability of these mutant cells to separate SPBs at the restrictive temperature was restored . In agreement with earlier studies [ 20 ] , [ 51 ] , [ 52 ] , we observed that an asynchronous culture of GENE1 - 3 cells arrests almost uniformly at the G1/S border with elongated buds , unreplicated DNA , and duplicated but unseparated SPBs 2 - 4 hours after being shifted to 37 C ( Figure 1 ) . In contrast , an asynchronous culture of GENE1 - 3 GENE2 arrests at 37 C with a majority of cells in G2/M with large , round buds and replicated DNA , as has been observed previously [ 20 ] , [ 52 ] . Most importantly , for this study , duplicated and separated SPBs were observed in the majority ( > 90 % ) of GENE1 - 3 GENE2 cells within 4 hours of the shift to the restrictive temperature ( Figure 1 ) . This finding indicates that the failure to separate SPBs in the absence of SCFCdc4 activity is due solely to the stabilization of Sic1 and the consequent inhibition of Clb/Cdc28 kinase activity . These results are consistent with observations made by Goh & Surana who observed the formation of short spindles by immunofluorescence in asynchronous GAL-CDC4 cdc4Delta GENE2 cells shifted to glucose to inhibit Cdc4 expression [ 53 ] . Those results were , however , inconclusive because the control cells ( PGAL1-CDC4 GENE1 ) used in that particular study did not arrest at the G1/S border , potentially due to the persistence of a low level of Cdc4 .
GENE1 deletion allows SPB separation and DNA replication in GENE2 - 3(ts ) cells at the restrictive temperature .
GENE1 - 4SA sensitizes cells that are defective in dNTP regulation . ( A ) rnr1-W688 G is sensitive to genotoxic stress . The DNA damage sensitivities of the strains [ wild type ( W1588 - 4C ) , rnr1-W688 G ( W4383 - 1B ) and rnr1-W688 G OTHER_GENE ( W4383 - 10C ) ] were examined in a quantitative survival assay used to determine the LD50 values after 4-NQO ( mg/l ) and MMS ( % ) treatments . Mid-log phase cultures were sonicated and appropriate dilutions were plated on YPD for viability , or on YPD plates containing 4NQO ( top ) and MMS ( bottom ) at various concentrations . The reported value is the mean of three experiments and the error bars represent the standard error of the mean . ( B ) rnr1-W688 G induces Rnr3 expression in the absence of exogenous damage . The activation of the DNA damage checkpoint was monitored through the induction of a YFP-Rnr3 fusion protein ( W6986 - 1B ) . Rnr3 is induced in response to DNA damage and the induction depends on checkpoint signaling ( 55 ) . In the absence of DNA damage , YFP-Rnr3 is not expressed in wild-type cells ( top ) . To induce YFP-Rnr3 expression , mid-log phase cells were treated with 0.1 % MMS for 5 h ( middle ) . The rnr1-W688 G mutation causes YFP-Rnr3 to be expressed without any exogenous DNA damage treatment ( bottom ) .

Deletion of OTHER_GENE suppresses the synthetic lethality between rnr1-W688 G and GENE2 . The four spores of each tetrad are positioned in the three rows shown .

Mid-log phase cultures were sonicated and appropriate dilutions were plated on YPD for viability , or on YPD plates containing 4NQO ( top ) and MMS ( bottom ) at various concentrations . The reported value is the mean of three experiments and the error bars represent the standard error of the mean . ( B ) rnr1-W688 G induces Rnr3 expression in the absence of exogenous damage . The activation of the DNA damage checkpoint was monitored through the induction of a YFP-Rnr3 fusion protein ( W6986 - 1B ) . Rnr3 is induced in response to DNA damage and the induction depends on checkpoint signaling ( 55 ) . In the absence of DNA damage , YFP-Rnr3 is not expressed in wild-type cells ( top ) . To induce YFP-Rnr3 expression , mid-log phase cells were treated with 0.1 % MMS for 5 h ( middle ) . The rnr1-W688 G mutation causes YFP-Rnr3 to be expressed without any exogenous DNA damage treatment ( bottom ) .

Next , we analyzed the spores from a cross between an rnr1-W688 G strain and a OTHER_GENE - 4SA strain to test the genetic interaction between stabilized Sml1 and this sensitizing mutation . Genetic analysis of this diploid shows that spores of the genotype rnr1-W688 G OTHER_GENE - 4SA are synthetic lethal ( Figure 4C , left ) . This interaction is identical to that seen when the rnr1-W688 G allele is combined with GENE1 ( Figure 4C , right ) , which is also defective for Sml1 degradation ( 22 ) as well as RNR regulation ( 12,43 ) . Furthermore , deletion of GENE2 suppresses the synthetic lethality between rnr1-W688 G and GENE1 ( Figure 4C , right ) . Interestingly , the levels of YFP-Sml1 fluorescent protein in an unperturbed rnr1-W688 G strain are undetectable ( data not shown ) , also indicating that there is a constitutively active checkpoint in this strain . However , even the low levels of Sml1 in an rnr1-W688 G strain must account for some dNTP inhibition , as deletion of GENE2 rescues the severe petite phenotype , indicative of low dNTP pools ( 18 ) observed in an rnr1-W688 G strain ( data not shown ) . Taken together , these results show that the degradation of Sml1 becomes essential in the rnr1-W688 G strain , likely due to the aberrant regulation of this sensitized RNR subunit .

GENE1 is a dosage suppressor of mps3-F592S . ( A ) Representative single-plane confocal images showing the localization of Mps3-GFP , mps3-F592S-GFP , or mps3Delta75 - 150-GFP ( green ) together with H2B-mCherry ( red ) . The cell is outlined in white based on the differential interference contrast ( DIC ) image . Bar , 2 microm . ( B ) mps3-F592S mutants ( SLJ1751 ) were transformed with a 2micro plasmid containing no insert , MPS3 , GENE1 , HTA1-HTB1 ( H2A-H2B ) , or HHT1-HHF1 ( H3-H4 ) and tested for their ability to grow at 23 and 37 C in a serial dilution assay . ( C ) Similarly , growth of each GENE2 mutant containing the indicated gene on a 2micro plasmid was analyzed at 37 C for 2 d in a serial dilution assay . Suppression was scored as follows : + + , growth at the fourth dilution and beyond ; + , growth at the second or third dilution ; + /- , growth only at the first dilution ; - , no growth above the background . ( D ) Liquid nitrogen ground lysates were prepared from wild-type ( SLJ001 ) , 3xHA-HTZ1 ( SLJ2082 ) , 3xHA-HTZ1 mps3Delta2 - 64 ( SLJ2326 ) , 3xHA-HTZ1 mps3Delta75 - 150 ( SLJ2322 ) , and 3xHA-HTZ1 mps3-F592S ( SLJ2324 ) strains grown at 23 C or shifted to 37 C for 3 h. The protein composition of lysates and anti-HA immunoprecipitates ( IP ) was analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Mps3 and anti-HA antibodies . Positions of molecular mass markers ( kilodaltons ) are indicated next to each blot , and the asterisk marks the position of the cross-reacting band present in the control sample . The minus sign represents the negative control strain used .
We isolated dosage suppressors of mps3-F592S to identify putative proteins that interact with OTHER_GENE at the INM . One of these suppressors included the ORF encoding the histone variant OTHER_GENE ( the OTHER_GENE gene ; hereafter referred to as GENE1 ) , which had previously been identified as an Mps3-interacting protein in the global yeast two-hybrid analysis and is a component of yeast chromatin ( Dhillon and Kamakaka , 2000 ; Uetz et al. , 2000 ; Wu et al. , 2005 ) . Overproduction of OTHER_GENE using a 2micro plasmid partially rescued the growth defect of mps3-F592S mutants at 37 C ( Fig. 1 B ) but not other GENE2 alleles , including the SUN domain mutants mps3-Q572LQ573L and mps3-A540D and the N-terminal mutant mps3Delta2 - 150 ( Fig. 1 C ; Jaspersen et al. , 2006 ; Bupp et al. , 2007 ) . Interestingly , suppression was specific to the variant histone GENE1 , as we were unable to restore growth by either independent or coordinate overexpression of genes encoding the canonical histones H2A , H2B , H3 , or H4 ( Fig. 1 B ) .

OTHER_GENE is a nucleic acid binding protein that , when mutated , can cause a subset                      of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( fALS ) . Although OTHER_GENE is normally                      located predominantly in the nucleus , the pathogenic mutant forms of OTHER_GENE                      traffic to , and form inclusions in , the cytoplasm of affected spinal motor                      neurons or glia . Here we report a yeast model of human OTHER_GENE expression that                      recapitulates multiple salient features of the pathology of the disease-causing                      mutant proteins , including nuclear to cytoplasmic translocation , inclusion                      formation , and cytotoxicity . Protein domain analysis indicates that the                      carboxyl-terminus of OTHER_GENE , where most of the ALS-associated mutations are                      clustered , is required but not sufficient for the toxicity of the protein .

Furthermore , GENE2 , a                      human homologue of OTHER_GENE , also rescues the toxicity of OTHER_GENE                      in this model , validating the yeast model and implicating a possible                      insufficiency in RNA processing or the RNA quality control machinery in the                      mechanism of OTHER_GENE mediated toxicity . Examination of the effect of OTHER_GENE                      expression on the decay of selected mRNAs in yeast indicates that the                      nonsense-mediated decay pathway is probably not the major determinant of either                      toxicity or suppression .

In this article , we report a yeast model of FUS/TLS-dependent cytotoxicity , in which                  over-expression and mislocalization of wild-type or mutant OTHER_GENE recapitulates the                  phenotypes of toxicity and inclusion formation observed in the human disease .                  Certain features of the model have allowed us to conclude that cytosolic                  localization of large amounts of even the wild-type FUS protein is sufficient to                  cause toxicity , supporting a hypothesis that had been put forward based on studies                  in mammalian cells . A genetic screen using this yeast model for suppressors of                  toxicity identifies , among other genes , the yeast gene OTHER_GENE , an                  RNA helicase involved in RNA quality control , as one that rescues OTHER_GENE toxicity                  when over-expressed . In addition , GENE1 , a human homolog of                      OTHER_GENE , rescues OTHER_GENE toxicity , as do its interacting partners                      GENE2 and ( to a lesser extent ) OTHER_GENE . The                  rescue does not involve a decrease in OTHER_GENE expression or a change in its                  localization or inclusion formation , but it does depend on intact functional domains                  of GENE1 . Since GENE1 plays an important function                  in mRNA quality control , our data raise the possibility that this pathway might be                  involved in the pathogenesis of FUS/TLS-associated ALS , and                  possibly of the disease in general . We have investigated the role of one aspect of                  RNA quality control , nonsense-mediated decay ( NMD ) , using the yeast model but find                  no evidence that NMD disruption is responsible for OTHER_GENE toxicity or that its                  upregulation is important for suppression .

We have investigated the role of one aspect of                  RNA quality control , nonsense-mediated decay ( NMD ) , using the yeast model but find                  no evidence that NMD disruption is responsible for OTHER_GENE toxicity or that its                  upregulation is important for suppression .
In this article , we report a yeast model of FUS/TLS-dependent cytotoxicity , in which                  over-expression and mislocalization of wild-type or mutant GENE1 recapitulates the                  phenotypes of toxicity and inclusion formation observed in the human disease .                  Certain features of the model have allowed us to conclude that cytosolic                  localization of large amounts of even the wild-type FUS protein is sufficient to                  cause toxicity , supporting a hypothesis that had been put forward based on studies                  in mammalian cells .

Based on sequence similarity ( ~30 % identity and ~50 %                      similarity in the helicase domain ) , GENE1 , a gene playing an                      important role in the pathway of nonsense-mediated decay ( NMD ) , is the closest                      human homolog of ECM32                      [ 39 ] .                      Because of this homology , we hypothesized that the toxicity of FUS/TLS may be                      rescued by yeast expression of GENE1 . The full-length                          GENE1 gene was cloned into a yeast expression vector and                      tested on the toxicity of FUS/TLS . Over-expression of GENE1                      rescues the toxicity of both OTHER_GENE and GENE2 ( Figure 7A and B ) . To check for possible                      direct interaction between GENE1 and FUS/TLS , we co-expressed red fluorescent                      protein-tagged GENE1 and GFP-tagged FUS/TLS . GENE1 is expressed mainly in the                      cytosol in yeast but does not co-localize with FUS/TLS ( Figure 7C ) , suggesting the rescue effect by                      GENE1 might be indirect . However , more data are needed to rule out possible                      over-expression artifacts .

Rescue of GENE1 toxicity requires full length                                  GENE2 , and rescue is not mediated                              by decrease in GENE1 protein level or inclusion formation of the                              protein .
To prevent the potential accumulation of deleterious nonsense fragments of                      polypeptides in the cytoplasm , mRNAs that retain an intron containing an                      in-frame nonsense codon are usually degraded by the nonsense-mediated decay                      ( NMD ) pathway . It is long established that CYH2 and                          MER2 pre-mRNA are among the substrates of this pathway in                      yeast . These pre-mRNAs are accumulated 2- to 5-fold when the NMD pathway is                      deficient [ 42 ] . To                      check the potential effects of GENE1 expression on the NMD pathway , qRT-PCR was                      utilized to determine CYH2 and MER2 pre-mRNA                      levels in 1XFUS yeast , and in its suppressor strains . As shown in Figure 9A ,                          CYH2 pre-mRNA was increased about 2-fold when GENE1 is                      over-expressed , and co-expression of its suppressor GENE2 brought                          CYH2 pre-mRNA back to the wild type level ; however ,                      co-expression of another suppressor , ECM32 , did not , suggesting                      that these two suppressors may rescue GENE1 toxicity through different                      mechanisms .
Most importantly , we found that expression of OTHER_GENE ( or of its                  physical interacting partner OTHER_GENE and , to a lesser extent ,                      GENE1 ) rescues GENE2 toxicity . Among other roles ,                      OTHER_GENE plays a very important function in mRNA quality control ,                  including nonsense-mediated decay ( NMD ) , a critical cellular mechanism of mRNA                  surveillance that functions to detect nonsense mutations and prevent the expression                  of truncated or erroneous proteins [ 43 ] . It has been proposed that a principal event underlying                  neurodegeneration occurs when cytotoxic , truncated proteins are expressed from                  normally degraded nonsense-containing RNAs and pseudogene transcripts [ 44 ] . Our finding                  that OTHER_GENE and OTHER_GENE rescue the toxicity of                  GENE2 is broadly consistent with this hypothesis ; however , our results from                  examination of the level of specific NMD mRNA substrates ( see below ) suggest that                  NMD can not be the sole RNA pathway affected by FUS or its suppressors in yeast . Our                  results do suggest the possibility that disruption of some part of the RNA quality                  control process might be related to the toxicity mechanism of GENE2 .

Because GENE1 , OTHER_GENE , or OTHER_GENE                  expression all rescue GENE2 toxicity without dissolving the cytosolic aggregates or                  changing the expression level of GENE2 or its mislocalization , it is likely that                  toxicity involves disruption of some essential cellular function that is either                  restored or compensated for by the introduction of these genes .

We next addressed whether the putative phosphorylation of S164 and S170 is the result of GENE1 activity in vivo . CDC7 is essential , but viability of a OTHER_GENE strain can be restored by the GENE2 mutation in mcm5 ( 47 ) . The OTHER_GENE GENE2 strain is sensitive to HU ( 47,48 ) . If Mcm2 is the key target of GENE1 leading to the HU sensitivity of the OTHER_GENE GENE2 strain , then the introduction of OTHER_GENE should suppress the HU sensitivity . As seen in Figure 3D , OTHER_GENE does suppresses the HU sensitivity as well as the caffeine sensitivity of the OTHER_GENE GENE2 strain . The difference in growth is dependent on the presence of the HU or caffeine since OTHER_GENE GENE2 grows similarly on YPD , regardless of whether the mcm2 allele is wild type or phosphomimic ( Figure 3D ) . This result supports the idea that GENE1 phosphorylates Mcm2 at S164 and S170 ; however , it is possible that interaction between mcm5-bob1 and OTHER_GENE accounts for the suppression of HU and caffeine sensitivity since MCM2 and MCM5 interact genetically ( 49 ) . A recent study in our lab ( Davey , M.J. , Andrighetti , H. , Ma , X. , and Brandl , C.J. , manuscript in preparation ) has shown that human GENE1 supports the essential functions of GENE1 in yeast , but that yeast with human GENE1 are sensitive to HU and caffeine ( Figure 3E ) . Of particular note , OTHER_GENE suppresses the sensitivity to HU and caffeine of cells with human GENE1 ( Figure 3E ) . The simplest explanation for these observations is that , unlike yeast GENE1 , human GENE1 fails to efficiently phosphorylate Mcm2 causing sensitivity to genotoxic agents , and that this defect is rescued by the phosphomimetic nature of Mcm2EE . Together , these findings implicate phosphorylation of Mcm2 at S164 and S170 by GENE1 in response to DNA damage and support the in vitro mapping of GENE1 sites in Mcm2 .
We next addressed whether the putative phosphorylation of S164 and S170 is the result of GENE1 activity in vivo . CDC7 is essential , but viability of a OTHER_GENE strain can be restored by the OTHER_GENE mutation in mcm5 ( 47 ) . The OTHER_GENE OTHER_GENE strain is sensitive to HU ( 47,48 ) . If Mcm2 is the key target of GENE1 leading to the HU sensitivity of the OTHER_GENE OTHER_GENE strain , then the introduction of GENE2 should suppress the HU sensitivity . As seen in Figure 3D , GENE2 does suppresses the HU sensitivity as well as the caffeine sensitivity of the OTHER_GENE OTHER_GENE strain . The difference in growth is dependent on the presence of the HU or caffeine since OTHER_GENE OTHER_GENE grows similarly on YPD , regardless of whether the mcm2 allele is wild type or phosphomimic ( Figure 3D ) . This result supports the idea that GENE1 phosphorylates Mcm2 at S164 and S170 ; however , it is possible that interaction between mcm5-bob1 and GENE2 accounts for the suppression of HU and caffeine sensitivity since MCM2 and MCM5 interact genetically ( 49 ) . A recent study in our lab ( Davey , M.J. , Andrighetti , H. , Ma , X. , and Brandl , C.J. , manuscript in preparation ) has shown that human GENE1 supports the essential functions of GENE1 in yeast , but that yeast with human GENE1 are sensitive to HU and caffeine ( Figure 3E ) . Of particular note , GENE2 suppresses the sensitivity to HU and caffeine of cells with human GENE1 ( Figure 3E ) .

We have mapped S164 and S170 in vitro as potential GENE1 sites , consistent with a previous study ( 21 ) . Two lines of evidence support the idea that these are GENE1 phosphorylation sites in vivo . First , OTHER_GENE suppresses the HU and caffeine sensitivity of a OTHER_GENE GENE2 strain . Second , the HU and caffeine sensitivity of a strain containing human GENE1 is also suppressed by OTHER_GENE . Furthermore , Mcm2 is already known to be a substrate for GENE1 in yeast ( 17 ) and GENE1 is known to have roles in responding to DNA damage ( 26,34,38,40,41,64 )

Our work has linked the Anaphase Promoting Complex ( APC ) , an evolutionarily conserved 13 subunit complex in yeast that is critical for mitotic progression and G1 maintenance [ 49 - 52 ] , with chromatin assembly and histone acetylation through genetic interactions with chromatin assembly factor ( CAF ) , HAT and HDAC mutants [ 53 - 57 ] . The APC is a ubiquitin-protein ligase ( E3 ) that targets proteins that block the initiation of anaphase ( Pds1 ) and mitotic exit ( Clb2 ) for degradation . Various regulators govern APC activity in positive and negative manners , from phosphorylation and transcriptional control of APC subunits , to sequestration of APC activators [ 58 - 63 ] . For example , protein kinase A ( a complex of Bcy1 , Tpk1 , Tpk2 and Tpk3 ) and Mad2 inhibit APC activity through phosphorylation and subunit sequestration , respectively . Activating phosphorylation is supplied by the polo-like kinase ( Cdc5 ) and Cdc28 . Furthermore , Cdc20 , inhibited by a Mad2-dependent mechanism , binds and activates the APC to promote the metaphase/anaphase transition , while Cdh1 , another APC-binding partner , drives APC-dependent mitotic exit . Previous studies by our group have expanded the APC 's functional repertoire by showing that the mutant APC subunit allele , GENE1 [ 54 ] , genetically interacted with deletions of the HAT encoding genes GCN5 and ELP3 [ 57 ] . Strains harboring the GENE1 OTHER_GENE or the GENE1 elp3Delta mutations had severely restricted growth at elevated temperatures compared to the single mutants . This interaction implies that the APC and these HATs positively interact , but a negative feedback loop appears apparent , as G1-specific Gcn5 instability was reduced in APC mutant cells . An additional synergistic genetic interaction between GENE2 and GENE1 was also observed , suggesting that the APC interacts positively with the HDAC Hda1 [ 57 ] . The study presented here focuses on a novel antagonistic relationship between OTHER_GENE and GENE2 that is revealed in GENE1 , but not APC5 cells . We provide further evidence that the APC works with multiple histone modifiers to drive cell cycle progression .

In a recent screen , we identified HAT ( OTHER_GENE ) and HDAC ( hda1Delta ) deletions that severely impacted the OTHER_GENE ( chromatin assembly defective ) [ 54,57 ] temperature sensitive ( ts ) phenotype , indicating that both proteins have a positive influence on Anaphase Promoting Complex ( APC ) activity . The OTHER_GENE mutation was identified in a chromatin assembly mutant screen ; the allele contains an AT deletion altering amino acid 12 , which created an in-frame stop codon 12 amino acids further along [ 54 ] . We recently observed that the apc5CA-TAP ( Tandem Affinity Protein purification ) protein migrates faster , with less intensity , than the wild type Apc5-TAP by SDS-PAGE , indicating that OTHER_GENE encodes an N-terminal truncation ( data not shown ) . Here we show that deletion of OTHER_GENE in OTHER_GENE cells had no apparent effect ( Figure 1A ) , whereas deletion of OTHER_GENE in OTHER_GENE OTHER_GENE cells improved ts growth . The OTHER_GENE background therefore allowed the study of a previously uncharacterized antagonistic interaction in yeast between GENE1 and GENE2 . Plant GCN5 was also found to interact antagonistically with HD1 , the GENE2 orthologue , to regulate light-responsive gene expression [ 64 ] , but mechanisms remained undetermined .

( B ) Serial dilutions using strains expressing the indicated plasmids were spotted onto SD-ura plates containing either 2 % glucose or 2 % galactose , and grown at 30 C for 2 and 3 days , respectively . ( C ) Protein lysates were prepared from the mutants shown and characterized by Westerns using the antibodies indicated . Antibodies against GAPDH were used as load controls .
A further connection between OTHER_GENE and OTHER_GENE was observed by the rescue of GALproAPC5-HA overexpression toxicity by deletion of GENE1 ( Figure 1B ) . It is unlikely that OTHER_GENE protein levels induced from the GAL promoter are compromised in OTHER_GENE cells , as expression of OTHER_GENE and GENE2 from the GAL promoter reduces OTHER_GENE growth . Overexpression of APC5 from the CUP1 promoter also reduced yeast replicative lifespan [ 60 ] . Rescue of APC5 toxicity by GENE1 deletion is consistent with our recently proposed hypothesis that OTHER_GENE is required for APC activity , and may provide an explanation as to why GENE1 [ 57 ] and GENE2 ( Figure 1B ) overexpression is toxic , considering that overabundance of OTHER_GENE is detrimental to cells .

Next , we asked whether mutations to APC5 influenced acetylation of histone H3 lysine 9 or 14 ( H3K9/14 ) in OTHER_GENE and GENE1 cells . Gcn5 appears to play a greater role on H3K9 , compared to H3K14 , whereas loss of HDA1 results in increased acetylation of both H3K9 and H3K14 ( Figure 1C ) . The OTHER_GENE background did not change the acetylation status of H3K9/14 in OTHER_GENE or GENE1 cells , suggesting the OTHER_GENE background may be revealing an effect other than global histone H3 acetylation . H3K9Ac was reduced in OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE GENE2 Delta and OTHER_GENE OTHER_GENE GENE1 cells , but not in OTHER_GENE GENE1 cells . The ability to acetylate H3K9 in OTHER_GENE GENE1 cells indicates that on a global level , other HATs can use H3K9 as a substrate . However , at the gene level , deletion of GCN5 was previously shown to reverse histone hyperacetylation at the PHO5 promoter when HDA1 was deleted [ 67 ] . Therefore , we tested whether transcript levels are influenced by OTHER_GENE in OTHER_GENE or GENE1 cells .

The GENE1 allele increases transcript levels in GENE2 cells
Since the OTHER_GENE allele had little effect on global histone H3K9/14 acetylation , we asked whether individual gene transcripts were altered . We chose to study several genes involved in APC function , as altered expression of APC regulators may underlie the observed growth phenotypes . Thus , we performed Northern and reverse transcriptase PCR ( rtPCR ) experiments to determine expression of CDC20 , OTHER_GENE , GENE1 and MAD2 . Cdc20 plays a positive role in APC activity , whereas Pds1 , Bcy1 and Mad2 have a negative impact [ 58 - 63 ] . Northerns ( Figure 2A ) and rtPCR ( data not shown ) both show that compared to RDN1 , expression of the tested transcripts were reduced in gcn5Delta cells , especially at 37 C , whereas transcripts in OTHER_GENE cells were relatively unimpaired . The bands from 2 Northerns and 2 rtPCR experiments were scanned , quantified and averaged , with the expression of each gene for each experiment normalized to RDN1 . This number is relative to expression in the wild type strain , which was set to 1 ( Figures 2B , C ) . Although previous microarray analyses in gcn5Delta and OTHER_GENE cells did not identify these genes [ 68,69 ] , the approximate 2-fold decrease in transcript levels in gcn5Delta cells ( Figure 2C ) suggests GENE2 is involved in expression of the tested genes . However , while the OTHER_GENE allele had no apparent effect on transcript levels in gcn5Delta cells , in OTHER_GENE OTHER_GENE cells , GENE1 transcripts ( Figure 2B ) and OTHER_GENE transcripts ( Figure 2C ) were clearly elevated . The loss of this effect in the triple mutant suggests GENE2 may be required for elevated transcription in OTHER_GENE OTHER_GENE cells .

The loss of this effect in the triple mutant suggests OTHER_GENE may be required for elevated transcription in GENE1 OTHER_GENE cells .
Since the GENE1 allele had little effect on global histone H3K9/14 acetylation , we asked whether individual gene transcripts were altered . We chose to study several genes involved in APC function , as altered expression of APC regulators may underlie the observed growth phenotypes . Thus , we performed Northern and reverse transcriptase PCR ( rtPCR ) experiments to determine expression of CDC20 , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE and MAD2 . Cdc20 plays a positive role in APC activity , whereas Pds1 , Bcy1 and Mad2 have a negative impact [ 58 - 63 ] . Northerns ( Figure 2A ) and rtPCR ( data not shown ) both show that compared to RDN1 , expression of the tested transcripts were reduced in gcn5Delta cells , especially at 37 C , whereas transcripts in GENE2 cells were relatively unimpaired . The bands from 2 Northerns and 2 rtPCR experiments were scanned , quantified and averaged , with the expression of each gene for each experiment normalized to RDN1 . This number is relative to expression in the wild type strain , which was set to 1 ( Figures 2B , C ) . Although previous microarray analyses in gcn5Delta and GENE2 cells did not identify these genes [ 68,69 ] , the approximate 2-fold decrease in transcript levels in gcn5Delta cells ( Figure 2C ) suggests OTHER_GENE is involved in expression of the tested genes . However , while the GENE1 allele had no apparent effect on transcript levels in gcn5Delta cells , in GENE1 GENE2 cells , OTHER_GENE transcripts ( Figure 2B ) and OTHER_GENE transcripts ( Figure 2C ) were clearly elevated . The loss of this effect in the triple mutant suggests OTHER_GENE may be required for elevated transcription in GENE1 GENE2 cells .
Expression of GENE1 , an APC antagonist , is specifically elevated in OTHER_GENE GENE2 cells at 37 C. ( A ) Northern analyses were conducted on total RNAs extracted from the various mutants and probed with sequences derived from the coding regions of the genes indicated . RDN37 - 2 ( RDN1 ) was used as a loading control . All bands from the 30 C experiments ( B ) and the 37 C experiments ( C ) were quantified by ImageJ and normalized to the RDN1 signal . Densitometry was performed on two Northern experiments and two reverse transcriptase experiments . The data was combined and the means and standard errors were plotted .

Our data suggests the GENE1 allele enhances the transcript levels of some of the tested genes in GENE2 cells . We next tested whether promoter acetylation of these genes was similarly impacted using chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) with antibodies that recognized acetylated lysines 9 and 14 on histone H3 ( H3K9/14Ac ) , and primers that amplified 200 basepair fragments immediately upstream of the transcriptional start site of the genes studied above . We used H3K9/K14Ac antibodies to capture acetylation of both H3K9 and H3K14 as our studies show these residues are targeted by Gcn5 and Hda1 . We assessed promoter acetylation in gcn5Delta , GENE2 and gcn5Delta hdaDelta1 mutants in the GENE1 background ( Figure 3A ) . Antibodies against total H3 and a no antibody mock treatment were used as controls . The bands in all experiments were quantified and analyzed ( Figure 3B ) . Once background densities were subtracted from all bands , the H3K9/14Ac/total H3 ratio was determined . The values represent two independent experiments , as described previously [ 66,70 ] . H3 promoter acetylation was reduced in both GENE1 gcn5Delta and GENE1 gcn5 GENE2 cells , similar to the transcript patterns at 37 C ( Figure 2C ) , strengthening the notion that Gcn5 HAT activity is tightly correlated with transcription . However , it is interesting to note that while promoter acetylation is equally low in GENE1 gcn5Delta cells at 30 and 37 C , transcript defects are only obvious at 37 C. Notably , a previous study observed that Gcn5-dependent transcription and promoter histone acetylation activities could be uncoupled [ 71 ] .
Consistent with our observations that transcript levels of GENE1 and OTHER_GENE increase in OTHER_GENE GENE2 cells , we detected increased GENE1 and OTHER_GENE promoter acetylation in these cells , specifically at 37 C. Transcript levels and promoter acetylation are both increased with OTHER_GENE at 37 C in OTHER_GENE GENE2 cells . However , we note some differences in the patterns observed . For example , GENE1 transcripts are not elevated in OTHER_GENE GENE2 cells at 37 C while promoter acetylation is . This may reflect the complex nature of the factors assembled at promoters that is not addressed in this study .

One possible scenario to explain increased PDS1 promoter acetylation and transcription in OTHER_GENE GENE1 cells may be increased availability of Gcn5 or related HATs due to the OTHER_GENE allele . It was previously reported that in cells expressing defective TUP1 , increased Gcn5 was observed at Tup1-repressible promoters , thereby derepressing transcription [ 40 ] . We have speculated that the APC may target Gcn5 for turnover in order to progress through the G1/S transition [ 57 ] . To examine this possibility , endogenous GCN5 was TAP-tagged in WT , OTHER_GENE and apc10Delta cells and detected by Westerns in asynchronous early log phase cells . Gcn5 protein levels were indeed increased in both OTHER_GENE and apc10Delta cells ( Figure 4A ) . While this does not explain the genetic interaction between GENE2 and GENE1 in OTHER_GENE cells , it does suggest the possibility that a factor related to Gcn5 may also be elevated in OTHER_GENE cells . Consistent with this hypothesis , we observed increased Gcn5-HA and Elp3-HA , expressed from the GAL promoter , in cells lacking the proteasome ubiquitin receptor Rpn10 ( Figure 4B ) . As controls , we TAP-tagged APC5 in rpn10Delta cells , which was unaffected by rpn10Delta . Furthermore , GAPDH was also unaffected by rpn10Delta , whereas ubiquitinated proteins did accumulate . Therefore , in cells lacking a functional ubiquitin system , at least Gcn5 and Elp3 accumulate .

To distinguish between these possibilities , we predicted that if Tup1 and Hda1 work together , then deletion of GENE1 in GENE2 cells should have the same synergistic effects as an HDA1 deletion . Our results show that deletion of GENE1 impairs the GENE2 phenotype ( Figure 6C ) , similar to an hda1Delta mutation . This suggests that both Hda1 and Tup1 perform a function that is beneficial to APC activity . However , it does not necessarily indicate they work together to perform this task .
The work presented here provides evidence to support a model in which the HAT GENE1 and the HDAC OTHER_GENE functionally interact at promoters to determine transcriptional readouts ( Figure 8) . In otherwise WT cells , mutations to GCN5 or HDA1 do not create significant growth defects , whereas in OTHER_GENE cells , these same mutations produce severe ts growth defects ( Figure 1A ) . The focus of this study was to characterize an antagonistic functional gcn5Delta/hda1Delta interaction revealed in the OTHER_GENE background , as the severe OTHER_GENE OTHER_GENE and OTHER_GENE GENE2 ts defects are suppressed in OTHER_GENE OTHER_GENE GENE2 cells . Growth phenotypes associated with deletion of GCN5 have been shown in two separate Synthetic Genetic Array ( SGA ) genome-wide screens to be suppressed by deletion of HDA1 [ 76,77 ] . However , spot dilution analysis of the OTHER_GENE and GENE2 cells on YPD did not reveal any phenotypes [ 76 ] , as shown in our study ( Figure 1A ) . Thus , the OTHER_GENE GENE2 antagonistic interaction is not apparent under normal growth conditions , such as on YPD , but under conditions imposed by the SGA screen ( selective media , for example ) , the antagonistic interaction can be exposed . The influence of the OTHER_GENE allele on this interaction was investigated . The OTHER_GENE allele had little effect on global histone H3 acetylation status in OTHER_GENE and GENE2 cells , but did cause the increase of BCY1 and PDS1 transcripts in GENE2 cells ( Figures 1C , 3 ) . Both Bcy1 and Pds1 proteins antagonize APC activity and may be involved in the enhanced growth defect when APC is mutated . Therefore , in OTHER_GENE cells , it may be the inappropriate expression of inhibitory transcripts that are paramount to synergistic OTHER_GENE OTHER_GENE and OTHER_GENE GENE2 phenotypes .

We set out to test our first prediction that Yck1/2 directly phosphorylate the prodomain . We reasoned that the spatial proximity of the kinase to its potential substrate OTHER_GENE might positively modulate pathway activation , and we investigated the effect of fusing GENE1 to the C terminus of OTHER_GENE . A chimeric Ssy5-Yck1 protein lacking the two C-terminal cysteine residues of GENE1 was constructed ; these cysteines normally serve as sites for palmitoylation that anchors the kinase to the plasma membrane ( Vancura et al. , 1994 ) . To test whether Ssy5-Yck1 bypasses the requirement of upstream signaling components , and thus exhibits constitutive signaling characteristics , the chimera was expressed in an OTHER_GENE OTHER_GENE OTHER_GENE strain . This strain lacks a functional SPS pathway and therefore has a severe defect in amino acid uptake and can not grow on yeast extract-peptone-dextrose ( YPD ) medium containing MM ( 2-{[({[(4-methoxy-6-methyl)-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl]-amino}carbonyl)amino-]-sulfonyl}-benzoic acid ) , an inhibitor of branched-chain amino acid synthesis ( Jorgensen et al. , 1998 ) . Whereas cells expressing WT GENE2 did not grow , we found that cells expressing SSY5-YCK1 grew robustly and similar to cells expressing GENE2 * , encoding a well-characterized constitutively active form of OTHER_GENE ( Figure 2A , compare lanes 1 , 2 , and 3 ) ( Andreasson et al. , 2006 ; Pfirrmann et al. , 2010 ) . The constitutive activity of Ssy5-Yck1 was dependent on the kinase activity of the chimeric protein , because a kinase-inactivating K98R mutation ( SSY5-yck1 ) in the ATP binding domain of GENE1 ( Wang et al. , 1992 ; Moriya and Johnston , 2004 ) abolished growth on YPD+MM ( Figure 2A , lane 4 ) . Importantly , in the context of an intact SPS sensor , the OTHER_GENE protease moiety encoded by the kinase-defective SSY5-yck1 allele was fully capable of mediating SPS pathway signaling ( Figure 2A , lane 5 ) , which indicates that the K98R mutation does not generally impair OTHER_GENE function .

A chimeric Ssy5-Yck1 protein lacking the two C-terminal cysteine residues of GENE1 was constructed ; these cysteines normally serve as sites for palmitoylation that anchors the kinase to the plasma membrane ( Vancura et al. , 1994 ) . To test whether Ssy5-Yck1 bypasses the requirement of upstream signaling components , and thus exhibits constitutive signaling characteristics , the chimera was expressed in an GENE2 OTHER_GENE OTHER_GENE strain . This strain lacks a functional SPS pathway and therefore has a severe defect in amino acid uptake and can not grow on yeast extract-peptone-dextrose ( YPD ) medium containing MM ( 2-{[({[(4-methoxy-6-methyl)-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl]-amino}carbonyl)amino-]-sulfonyl}-benzoic acid ) , an inhibitor of branched-chain amino acid synthesis ( Jorgensen et al. , 1998 ) . Whereas cells expressing WT OTHER_GENE did not grow , we found that cells expressing SSY5-YCK1 grew robustly and similar to cells expressing OTHER_GENE * , encoding a well-characterized constitutively active form of OTHER_GENE ( Figure 2A , compare lanes 1 , 2 , and 3 ) ( Andreasson et al. , 2006 ; Pfirrmann et al. , 2010 ) . The constitutive activity of Ssy5-Yck1 was dependent on the kinase activity of the chimeric protein , because a kinase-inactivating K98R mutation ( SSY5-yck1 ) in the ATP binding domain of GENE1 ( Wang et al. , 1992 ; Moriya and Johnston , 2004 ) abolished growth on YPD+MM ( Figure 2A , lane 4 ) . Importantly , in the context of an intact SPS sensor , the OTHER_GENE protease moiety encoded by the kinase-defective SSY5-yck1 allele was fully capable of mediating SPS pathway signaling ( Figure 2A , lane 5 ) , which indicates that the K98R mutation does not generally impair OTHER_GENE function .

Our ability to detect a direct physical interaction between Ssy5-L126S V129A E131A and Grr1 , and the fact that this mutant protein exhibits constitutively down-regulated levels of its prodomain ( Pfirrmann et al. , 2010 ) , led us to hypothesize that this constitutive Ssy5 mutant adopts a prodomain conformation that attracts Yck1/2 phosphorylation and subsequent SCFGrr1-dependent ubiquitylation . We examined whether the constitutive activity of Ssy5-L126S V129A E131A was SCF Grr1-dependent by monitoring growth on YPD+MM of grr1Delta ssy5Delta cells expressing this mutant protein . We found a strict requirement for Grr1 activity for growth and GENE1 processing ( Figure 3D , compare dilution series/lanes 5 and 8) . In contrast , control cells expressing the GRR1-independent and constitutive GENE2 * allele exhibited robust growth in the presence of MM , and , accordingly , GENE1 processing was observed .
Impaired nuclear division in Cdc55-depleted cells is not caused by unresolved linkages between chromosomes because ablating linkages genetically did not restore nuclear division . SPO11 , which is required for chiasmata formation ( Keeney et al. , 1997 ) , MAM1 , encoding a monopolin subunit ( Toth et al. , 2000 ) , and OTHER_GENE , encoding a meiosis-specific cohesin subunit ( Klein et al. , 1999 ) , were deleted in GENE1 cells alone and in combination . However , none of these deletions improved nuclear division in GENE1 cells nor did they radically alter the frequency ( ~30 % ) of binucleate cells with heterozygous CEN5-GFP in both nuclei or homozygous CEN5-GFP in one nucleus ( ~50 % ; Fig. S1 ) . Only deletion of OTHER_GENE slightly increased the percentage of GENE2 GENE1 binucleate cells with either heterozygous or homozygous CEN5-GFP foci in both nuclei ( Fig. S1 ) . This indicates that only cohesin-dependent linkages contribute to the segregation pattern of GENE1 cells .

SPO11 , which is required for chiasmata formation ( Keeney et al. , 1997 ) , MAM1 , encoding a monopolin subunit ( Toth et al. , 2000 ) , and GENE1 , encoding a meiosis-specific cohesin subunit ( Klein et al. , 1999 ) , were deleted in GENE2 cells alone and in combination . However , none of these deletions improved nuclear division in GENE2 cells nor did they radically alter the frequency ( ~30 % ) of binucleate cells with heterozygous CEN5-GFP in both nuclei or homozygous CEN5-GFP in one nucleus ( ~50 % ; Fig. S1 ) . Only deletion of GENE1 slightly increased the percentage of OTHER_GENE GENE2 binucleate cells with either heterozygous or homozygous CEN5-GFP foci in both nuclei ( Fig. S1 ) . This indicates that only cohesin-dependent linkages contribute to the segregation pattern of GENE2 cells .

Inactivation of GENE1 not only rescued the spindle assembly defect of OTHER_GENE cells but also partially alleviated the delay in GENE2 destruction . GENE2 stabilization in OTHER_GENE cells might occur because the absence of a spindle would inevitably result in unattached kinetochores that could engage the spindle assembly checkpoint ( SAC ) . Indeed , in cells lacking MAD2 , which is required for a functional SAC ( Shonn et al. , 2000 ) , GENE2 degradation and Rec8 cleavage were initiated with similar timing whether or not Cdc55 was present ( 7 h ; Fig. 2 , E and F ) . For reasons that are unclear , the percentage of Pds1-positive cells in the pachytene arrest ( 6 h ) were higher in OTHER_GENE cultures , independent of MAD2 or CDC14 . Nevertheless , these findings indicate that ectopic GENE1 activation in OTHER_GENE cells prevents spindle assembly , which leads to activation of the SAC .

Although inactivation of GENE1 or OTHER_GENE alleviated the delay to the first wave of OTHER_GENE destruction and GENE2 cleavage in OTHER_GENE cells , full-length GENE2 was present at later time points in cultures in which Cdc55 was depleted ( Fig. 2 , C-F ) . This suggested that Cdc55 might also have Cdc14-independent roles in ensuring timely cleavage of cohesin during meiosis II .

Inactivation of GENE1 in GENE2 cells rescues homologue , but not sister , segregation
We took advantage of the cdc14 - 1 background to ask whether defective spindle assembly alone accounted for the missegregation of chromosomes in GENE1 cells . Examination of homozygous CEN5-GFP dots showed that homologue segregation in the GENE1 strain was rescued by inactivation of GENE2 because the GFP label was found in both nuclei of virtually all cdc14 - 1 GENE1 binucleate cells ( Fig. 3 A ) . Analysis of heterozygous CEN5-GFP foci revealed that , surprisingly , inactivation of GENE2 did not reduce the frequency of equational segregation in GENE1 cells ( Fig. 3 B ) . We found previously that the cdc14 - 1 mutant undergoes a normal reductional meiosis I but that , subsequently , a fraction ( 10 - 15 % ) of sister chromatids segregate equationally on the same axis during meiosis II ( Marston et al. , 2003 ) . We asked whether a similar increase in equational segregation occurs over time in cdc14 - 1 GENE1 cells . As expected , virtually all wild-type binucleate cells from all time points analyzed had a heterozygous CEN5-GFP label in just one nucleus ( Fig. 3 C ) , whereas ~30 % of binucleate GENE1 cells had a GFP label in both nuclei ( Fig. 3 D ) . Consistent with previous results ( Marston et al. , 2003 ) , the first binucleate cells to appear in cdc14 - 1 cultures had a GFP label in one nucleus and only later were up to ~10 % of cells observed with a GFP label in both nuclei ( Fig. 3 E ) . In cdc14 - 1 GENE1 cells , segregation of CEN5-GFP to the same nucleus was also observed first ; however , the frequency of subsequent segregation to opposite nuclei was greatly increased , up to ~50 % ( Fig. 3 F ) . These results indicate that Cdc55 has effects on chromosome segregation that are independent of its role in controlling GENE2 .
The GENE1 - 1 mutation rescues homologue segregation in GENE2 cells but does not prevent equational segregation on the same axis . ( A ) Segregation of homozygous CEN5-GFP foci in > = 1,000 binucleate cells of wild-type ( AM6040 ) , GENE2 ( AM5936 ) , GENE1 - 1 ( AM6902 ) , and GENE1 - 1 GENE2 ( AM6908 ) strains were determined as described in Fig. 1 D. ( B-F ) Segregation of heterozygous CEN5-GFP in wild-type ( AM4796 ) , GENE2 ( AM4891 ) , GENE1 - 1 ( AM6910 ) , and GENE1 - 1 GENE2 ( AM6934 ) cells . ( B ) Segregation in binucleate cells was determined as described in A. ( C-F ) The total percentage of binucleate and tetranucleate cells and the percentage of binucleate cells that have GFP foci in one , both , or between the two nuclei are shown for a representative experiment .
Next , we asked why depletion of Cdc55 increases equational segregation in the OTHER_GENE - 1 background . One explanation could be that during meiosis I , sister kinetochores fail to attach to microtubules from the same spindle pole body ( monoorientation ) and attach to microtubules from opposite poles ( biorientation ) instead . This would lead to the equational segregation of sister chromatids only once centromeric cohesion is lost at meiosis II . Indeed , CDC55 was previously identified in a screen to uncover new components of the monopolin complex that specifies monoorientation during meiosis I ( Rabitsch et al. , 2003 ) . However , analysis of the monopolin subunit Mam1 on spread meiotic nuclei indicated that it was recruited to and disappeared from kinetochores with similar timing to that in wild type in OTHER_GENE cells ( Fig. 5 , A-D ) . We monitored the splitting of heterozygous CEN5-GFP foci that occurs only when sister kinetochores are bioriented in metaphase I-arrested cells ( by depletion of the anaphase-promoting complex activator Cdc20 ; Lee and Amon , 2003 ) . Because the absence of spindles in OTHER_GENE cells precludes CEN5-GFP separation even when sister kinetochores are bioriented ( Fig. S4 ) , we conducted this experiment in the OTHER_GENE - 1 background . In OTHER_GENE OTHER_GENE - 1 control cells , little sister centromere separation was observed , as sister kinetochores are monooriented , whereas deletion of GENE1 resulted in CEN5-GFP separation in up to 50 % of cells ( Fig. S4 ) . Similarly , a high frequency of sister centromere separation was observed in OTHER_GENE - 1 GENE2 OTHER_GENE cells ( although not to the same level as a OTHER_GENE - 1 GENE2 for unknown reasons ; Fig. S4 ) . The frequency of centromere splitting was lower in OTHER_GENE - 1 OTHER_GENE cells with intact GENE1 , indicating that kinetochore monoorientation is at least partially functional in OTHER_GENE cells ( Fig. S4 ) . To further address this issue , we assessed the contribution of monopolin to the segregation pattern of OTHER_GENE cells with a spindle ( Fig. S4 and Fig. 5 , E-H ) . Deletion of GENE1 in either the OTHER_GENE - 1 or OTHER_GENE - 1 OTHER_GENE strain resulted in the equational segregation of heterozygous CEN5-GFP foci in the majority of binucleate cells ( Fig. 5 , G and H ) , arguing that the majority of sister kinetochores monoorient in OTHER_GENE cells . Furthermore , binucleate cells with partially divided nuclei and GFP foci trapped in the middle were prevalent in the OTHER_GENE - 1 GENE2 OTHER_GENE but not in the OTHER_GENE - 1 GENE2 culture ( Fig. 5 , G and H ) . These observations indicate that Cdc55 is not required for kinetochore monoorientation but rather suggest that Cdc55 promotes the timely resolution of sister chromatids at meiosis II .

To further address this issue , we assessed the contribution of monopolin to the segregation pattern of GENE1 cells with a spindle ( Fig. S4 and Fig. 5 , E-H ) . Deletion of GENE2 in either the OTHER_GENE - 1 or OTHER_GENE - 1 GENE1 strain resulted in the equational segregation of heterozygous CEN5-GFP foci in the majority of binucleate cells ( Fig. 5 , G and H ) , arguing that the majority of sister kinetochores monoorient in GENE1 cells . Furthermore , binucleate cells with partially divided nuclei and GFP foci trapped in the middle were prevalent in the OTHER_GENE - 1 OTHER_GENE GENE1 but not in the OTHER_GENE - 1 OTHER_GENE culture ( Fig. 5 , G and H ) . These observations indicate that Cdc55 is not required for kinetochore monoorientation but rather suggest that Cdc55 promotes the timely resolution of sister chromatids at meiosis II .
Next , we asked why depletion of Cdc55 increases equational segregation in the OTHER_GENE - 1 background . One explanation could be that during meiosis I , sister kinetochores fail to attach to microtubules from the same spindle pole body ( monoorientation ) and attach to microtubules from opposite poles ( biorientation ) instead . This would lead to the equational segregation of sister chromatids only once centromeric cohesion is lost at meiosis II . Indeed , CDC55 was previously identified in a screen to uncover new components of the monopolin complex that specifies monoorientation during meiosis I ( Rabitsch et al. , 2003 ) . However , analysis of the monopolin subunit Mam1 on spread meiotic nuclei indicated that it was recruited to and disappeared from kinetochores with similar timing to that in wild type in GENE1 cells ( Fig. 5 , A-D ) . We monitored the splitting of heterozygous CEN5-GFP foci that occurs only when sister kinetochores are bioriented in metaphase I-arrested cells ( by depletion of the anaphase-promoting complex activator Cdc20 ; Lee and Amon , 2003 ) . Because the absence of spindles in GENE1 cells precludes CEN5-GFP separation even when sister kinetochores are bioriented ( Fig. S4 ) , we conducted this experiment in the OTHER_GENE - 1 background . In GENE2 OTHER_GENE - 1 control cells , little sister centromere separation was observed , as sister kinetochores are monooriented , whereas deletion of OTHER_GENE resulted in CEN5-GFP separation in up to 50 % of cells ( Fig. S4 ) . Similarly , a high frequency of sister centromere separation was observed in OTHER_GENE - 1 OTHER_GENE GENE1 cells ( although not to the same level as a OTHER_GENE - 1 OTHER_GENE for unknown reasons ; Fig. S4 ) .

Two lines of evidence indicate that the overprotection of cohesin could provide the persistent linkages between sister chromatids in GENE1 cells . First , Rec8 is slow to be removed from centromeres in GENE1 cells ( Fig. S2 ) . Second , full-length , faster migrating Rec8 persists after the second round of securin degradation in GENE2 - 1 GENE1 and mad2Delta GENE1 cells ( Fig. 2 , D and F ) , suggesting that it is the unphosphorylated form that is resistant to separase-dependent cleavage . Cohesin is protected by the recruitment of PP2A complexed with the alternative regulatory subunit Rts1 ( PP2ARts1 ) to the pericentromere by Sgo1 ( Clift and Marston , 2011 ) . Consistent with the persistence of Rec8 at centromeres ( Fig. S2 ) , we found that Sgo1 removal from centromeres was delayed in GENE1 cells ( Fig. 7 , A-F ) . To ask whether overprotection of Rec8 by Sgo1 causes equational segregation in GENE2 - 1 GENE1 cells , we depleted Sgo1 in meiotic cells and analyzed the segregation of heterozygous CEN5-GFP in binucleate cells . Remarkably , CEN5-GFP segregation was reductional in virtually all GENE2 - 1 OTHER_GENE GENE1 binucleate cells ( Fig. 7 G ) . Depletion of Sgo1 prevents equational segregation caused by the abolishment of cohesin protection rather than some other function of Sgo1 because replacement of Rec8 by the mitotic cohesin Scc1 , which is refractory to Sgo1-PP2ARts1 protection ( Toth et al. , 2000 ) , also abolished equational segregation in GENE2 - 1 GENE1 cells ( Fig. 7 H ) . Furthermore , the accumulation of metaphase I spindles in GENE2 - 1 GENE1 cells was abolished by either Sgo1 depletion or replacement of Rec8 by Scc1 ( Fig. S5 ) . We conclude that overprotection of cohesin precludes the timely resolution of linkages to allow equational segregation on the same axis during meiosis I in GENE2 - 1 GENE1 mutants .

OTHER_GENE interacts genetically with multiple chromatin modifiers [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] . Blake et al. in particular , demonstrated that Deltadia2 was synthetically lethal with deletion in genes involved in maintaining chromatin structure such as Htz1 , Hst4 , Swr1 , Sgf29 and Npt1 . This opens the possibility that in addition to its role in replication [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] , [ 18 ] , OTHER_GENE may be involved in other aspects of chromatin metabolism such as the control of transcription . Whilst investigating proteins , which exhibit synthetic lethality with RSC complex , we noticed a strong genetic interaction between several subunits of the RSC complex and OTHER_GENE ( Fig. 1 ) . Using an assay that made use of inducible degron mutants of RSC complex components [ 11 ] ( see Figs 1A and 1B for experimental design ) , we found that deletion of GENE1 was synthetically lethal with OTHER_GENE , GENE2 and OTHER_GENE td subunits of the RSC complex upon induction of the OTHER_GENE ubiquitin ligase that targets the degron fusion proteins for destruction , at the semi-permissive temperature of 30 degrees ( Fig. 1 ) . Results of all other RSC subunits tested are shown in supplementary Fig. S1 .

GENE1 and GENE2 synergistically regulate ATM activation
Protein ubiquitination is a critical component of the DNA damage response . To study the mechanism of the DNA damage-induced ubiquitination pathway , we analyzed the impact of the loss of two E3 ubiquitin ligases , GENE1 and GENE2 . Interestingly , DNA damage-induced ATM activation is suppressed in GENE1 and GENE2 double-deficient ( DKO ) cells , and DKO mice develop thymic lymphomas that are nearly diploid but harbor clonal chromosome translocations . Moreover , DKO mice and cells are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation . We show evidence that GENE1 and GENE2 synergistically regulate histone ubiquitination to control histone H4K16 acetylation through MRG15-dependent acetyltransferase complexes . Through these complexes , GENE1 and CHFR affect chromatin relaxation and modulate ATM activation and DNA damage response pathways . Collectively , our findings demonstrate that two chromatin remodeling factors , GENE1 and GENE2 , function together to activate ATM and maintain genomic stability in vivo .
Since GENE1 and GENE2 share similar functional domains and interact with the same E2 ubiquitin conjugase , we wondered whether GENE1 and GENE2 could be functional paralogs in the same biological processes . By analyzing GENE1 and Chfr-deficient mice , we find that GENE1 and GENE2 synergistically maintain genomic stability and suppress tumor development in vivo by regulating histone modifications and the ATM-dependent DNA damage response pathway following DSBs . Our results demonstrate the in vivo functional significance and molecular mechanisms of a pair of FHA and Ring domain proteins .
GENE1 and GENE2 double-deficient mice develop T-cell lymphoma
To examine whether GENE1 and GENE2 regulate ATM function in vivo , we generated a cohort containing 20 GENE1 + /+ GENE2 + /+ ( wild type ) , 20 GENE1 -/- GENE2 + /+ ( GENE1 KO ) , 20 GENE1 + /+ GENE2 -/- ( GENE2 KO ) and 20 GENE1 -/- GENE2 -/- ( DKO ) mice . Interestingly , although DKO mice were viable , 40 % of DKO mice developed thymic lymphoma and became moribund within six months , whereas no tumor incidence or lethality was observed in the wild type , GENE1 KO or GENE2 KO mice during this time ( Figure 2a and b ) . Besides thymic lymphoma , we did not find any other type of tumor in DKO mice . Flow cytometry analysis showed that tumor cells from DKO mice were CD4 + CD8 + T cells , indicating that these lymphomas developed during the CD4CD8 double positive selection stage ( Figure 2c ) . Histological examination showed that the tumor cells were large-size lymphoblasts . Mitotic figures were observed in tumor tissues , indicating the fast growth of these lymphomas ( Figure 2d ) . Thus , these results suggest that the loss of GENE1 and GENE2 induces lymphomagenesis in vivo , which is very similar to the phenotype of ATM -/- mice 8 , 9 .
In addition to lymphomagenesis , ATM-deficient mice and cells are hypersensitive to DNA damaging agents , such as IR 8 , 9 . To examine whether GENE1 and GENE2 function in the ATM pathway , 8-week old wild type , GENE1 KO , GENE2 KO and DKO mice were exposed to 8 Gy of IR . We monitored mouse mortality for 4 weeks . During this period , 17 % of the wild type and 58 % of the GENE2 KO mice died , whereas all of the GENE1 KO and DKO mice died ( Figure 4a ) . Compared with GENE1 KO mice , the DKO mice died much earlier . No DKO mice survived beyond 15 days following IR treatment , which is also very similar to the survival seen in ATM -/- mice 8 , 9 . Consistent with these results , DKO MEFs were hypersensitive to IR treatment ( Figure 4b ) . Both GENE1 KO MEFs and GENE2 KO MEFs showed higher lethality compared with wild type MEFs , but had better viability than DKO MEFs following DNA damage ( Figure 4b ) . Moreover , we also examined metaphase spreads of wild type , GENE1 KO , GENE2 KO and DKO MEFs 2 hours after treatment 1 Gy of IR . This assay allows us to quantitatively measure breaks introduced into mitosis , which could lead to chromosome instability . As shown in Figure 4c and Supplementary Figure 3 , chromosomal breaks were much more frequently found in DKO MEFs than in wild type MEFs . Compared with wild type MEFs , both GENE1 KO and GENE2 KO MEFs had elevated numbers of chromosomal breaks . Taken together , these results indicate that GENE1 and GENE2 synergistically maintain whole body or cell viability and chromosomal stability in response to DNA damage following DSBs .
GENE1 and GENE2 synergistically regulate histone ubiquitination and acetylation
In this study , we demonstrate that GENE1 and GENE2 synergistically maintain genomic stability and suppress lymphomagenesis in vivo . Both GENE1 and GENE2 are important for histone ubiquitination and acetylation , which in turn regulate chromatin structure and ATM-dependent DNA damage response ( Figure 8) .
In summary , we have shown that GENE1 and GENE2 , two chromatin remodelers , synergistically maintain chromatin stability and suppress lymphomagenesis by regulating ATM-dependent DNA damage response .

GENE1 and GENE2 synergistically regulate histone ubiquitination and acetylation
The OTHER_GENE ts strain and the OTHER_GENE ts strain were screened in triplicate against an ordered array of ~4700 viable gene-deletion strains and the relative growth of the double mutants was scored at 30 C as described previously ( 43 ) . Random spore analysis was then used to validate candidate genetic interactions identified in our SGA screen . We also used random spore analysis to test selected candidates revealed by an E-MAP analysis of deletion mutants of other Mediator subunits encoded by non-essential genes ( 44 ) . Two strains with different ts alleles of med4 were both found to be unsuitable for SGA analysis due to a low overall fitness in all double deletion strains . We sought to identify genes that would elucidate a potential role of Middle module subunits in Mediator localization and transcriptional repression . Thus , we were particularly interested in deletion mutants that had synthetic interactions with the OTHER_GENE ts mutant ( Middle module ) , but not the OTHER_GENE ts mutant ( Head module ) . All gene deletions that showed interactions with our mutants ( Figures 3 and 4 ) and all gene deletions lacking an interaction ( Tables 2 and 3 ) were confirmed by random spore analysis . First , we compiled a large set of synthetic interactions with the OTHER_GENE ts mutant ( Figure 3 and Table 2 ) . We also validated a subset of synthetic interactions with the OTHER_GENE ts ( Figure 4 ) . To determine whether potential interactions were specific to the OTHER_GENE ts , we tested whether mutants that had synthetic interactions with the OTHER_GENE ts also had synthetic interactions with the OTHER_GENE ts ( Figure 4 and Table 3 ) . There are certainly additional synthetic interactions for the OTHER_GENE ts mutant , but these were not validated with random spore analysis . Many of the basic synthetic interactions observed with the OTHER_GENE ts mutant ( Figure 3 ) could also be seen with other Mediator deletion mutants , in all sub-modules . Among these are strong synthetic interactions with other subunits of the core Mediator complex , as well as the Swr-Complex and GENE1 ( 44 ) . These strong genetic interactions are also observed for the OTHER_GENE ts mutant . Akin to other Mediator subunits in the Middle module [ Med1 , Med9(Cse2 ) and Med31(Soh1 ) ] and the Middle/tail interface [ Med16(Sin4 ) , Med5(Nut1 ) ] , the OTHER_GENE ts mutant also shows synthetic interactions with components of chromatin remodeling complexes as well as complexes involved in transcriptional elongation and the modification of chromatin during elongation . OTHER_GENE and the pathways leading to Histone H3 K4 and K36 methylation have synthetic phenotypes with the OTHER_GENE ts mutant . With the exception of OTHER_GENE , the OTHER_GENE ts mutant also interacts with these pathways ( Figure 4 ) . A distinguishing feature of OTHER_GENE ts that was not seen in the OTHER_GENE ts strain is strong genetic interactions with deletions of GENE2 , OTHER_GENE and OTHER_GENE ( Table 2 ) , which are all components of complexes involved in histone deacetylation and transcriptional repression ( 48,49 ) . Although the published E-MAP data set is not complete for interactions with the hda1 and hst2 deletions , these studies did find a synthetic interaction between both med16(sin4 ) and med5(nut1 ) deletions , and the hda1 deletion ( 44 ) . Med16(Sin4 ) and Med5(Nut1 ) are on the interface of the Middle and Tail module . Both subunits are also strongly implicated in affecting chromatin structure and transcriptional silencing ( 13,23,32 ) . These specific genetic interactions between the HDACs and Mediator subunits involved in repression led us to further investigate whether direct chromatin interactions , perhaps regulated by post-translational modification of histones , played a role in Mediator localization .

Although the published E-MAP data set is not complete for interactions with the hda1 and hst2 deletions , these studies did find a synthetic interaction between both med16(sin4 ) and med5(nut1 ) deletions , and the hda1 deletion ( 44 ) . Med16(Sin4 ) and Med5(Nut1 ) are on the interface of the Middle and Tail module . Both subunits are also strongly implicated in affecting chromatin structure and transcriptional silencing ( 13,23,32 ) . These specific genetic interactions between the HDACs and Mediator subunits involved in repression led us to further investigate whether direct chromatin interactions , perhaps regulated by post-translational modification of histones , played a role in Mediator localization .    
The OTHER_GENE ts strain and the OTHER_GENE ts strain were screened in triplicate against an ordered array of ~4700 viable gene-deletion strains and the relative growth of the double mutants was scored at 30 C as described previously ( 43 ) . Random spore analysis was then used to validate candidate genetic interactions identified in our SGA screen . We also used random spore analysis to test selected candidates revealed by an E-MAP analysis of deletion mutants of other Mediator subunits encoded by non-essential genes ( 44 ) . Two strains with different ts alleles of med4 were both found to be unsuitable for SGA analysis due to a low overall fitness in all double deletion strains . We sought to identify genes that would elucidate a potential role of Middle module subunits in Mediator localization and transcriptional repression . Thus , we were particularly interested in deletion mutants that had synthetic interactions with the OTHER_GENE ts mutant ( Middle module ) , but not the OTHER_GENE ts mutant ( Head module ) . All gene deletions that showed interactions with our mutants ( Figures 3 and 4 ) and all gene deletions lacking an interaction ( Tables 2 and 3 ) were confirmed by random spore analysis . First , we compiled a large set of synthetic interactions with the OTHER_GENE ts mutant ( Figure 3 and Table 2 ) . We also validated a subset of synthetic interactions with the OTHER_GENE ts ( Figure 4 ) . To determine whether potential interactions were specific to the OTHER_GENE ts , we tested whether mutants that had synthetic interactions with the OTHER_GENE ts also had synthetic interactions with the OTHER_GENE ts ( Figure 4 and Table 3 ) . There are certainly additional synthetic interactions for the OTHER_GENE ts mutant , but these were not validated with random spore analysis . Many of the basic synthetic interactions observed with the OTHER_GENE ts mutant ( Figure 3 ) could also be seen with other Mediator deletion mutants , in all sub-modules . Among these are strong synthetic interactions with other subunits of the core Mediator complex , as well as the Swr-Complex and GENE1 ( 44 ) . These strong genetic interactions are also observed for the OTHER_GENE ts mutant . Akin to other Mediator subunits in the Middle module [ Med1 , Med9(Cse2 ) and Med31(Soh1 ) ] and the Middle/tail interface [ Med16(Sin4 ) , Med5(Nut1 ) ] , the OTHER_GENE ts mutant also shows synthetic interactions with components of chromatin remodeling complexes as well as complexes involved in transcriptional elongation and the modification of chromatin during elongation .

With the exception of OTHER_GENE , the OTHER_GENE ts mutant also interacts with these pathways ( Figure 4 ) .

To determine whether potential interactions were specific to the GENE1 ts , we tested whether mutants that had synthetic interactions with the GENE1 ts also had synthetic interactions with the OTHER_GENE ts ( Figure 4 and Table 3 ) . There are certainly additional synthetic interactions for the OTHER_GENE ts mutant , but these were not validated with random spore analysis . Many of the basic synthetic interactions observed with the GENE1 ts mutant ( Figure 3 ) could also be seen with other Mediator deletion mutants , in all sub-modules . Among these are strong synthetic interactions with other subunits of the core Mediator complex , as well as the Swr-Complex and GENE2 ( 44 ) . These strong genetic interactions are also observed for the OTHER_GENE ts mutant . Akin to other Mediator subunits in the Middle module [ Med1 , Med9(Cse2 ) and Med31(Soh1 ) ] and the Middle/tail interface [ Med16(Sin4 ) , Med5(Nut1 ) ] , the GENE1 ts mutant also shows synthetic interactions with components of chromatin remodeling complexes as well as complexes involved in transcriptional elongation and the modification of chromatin during elongation . OTHER_GENE and the pathways leading to Histone H3 K4 and K36 methylation have synthetic phenotypes with the GENE1 ts mutant . With the exception of OTHER_GENE , the OTHER_GENE ts mutant also interacts with these pathways ( Figure 4 ) . A distinguishing feature of GENE1 ts that was not seen in the OTHER_GENE ts strain is strong genetic interactions with deletions of OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE and OTHER_GENE ( Table 2 ) , which are all components of complexes involved in histone deacetylation and transcriptional repression ( 48,49 ) . Although the published E-MAP data set is not complete for interactions with the hda1 and hst2 deletions , these studies did find a synthetic interaction between both med16(sin4 ) and med5(nut1 ) deletions , and the hda1 deletion ( 44 ) . Med16(Sin4 ) and Med5(Nut1 ) are on the interface of the Middle and Tail module . Both subunits are also strongly implicated in affecting chromatin structure and transcriptional silencing ( 13,23,32 ) . These specific genetic interactions between the HDACs and Mediator subunits involved in repression led us to further investigate whether direct chromatin interactions , perhaps regulated by post-translational modification of histones , played a role in Mediator localization .    
The GENE1 ts strain and the GENE2 ts strain were screened in triplicate against an ordered array of ~4700 viable gene-deletion strains and the relative growth of the double mutants was scored at 30 C as described previously ( 43 ) . Random spore analysis was then used to validate candidate genetic interactions identified in our SGA screen . We also used random spore analysis to test selected candidates revealed by an E-MAP analysis of deletion mutants of other Mediator subunits encoded by non-essential genes ( 44 ) . Two strains with different ts alleles of med4 were both found to be unsuitable for SGA analysis due to a low overall fitness in all double deletion strains . We sought to identify genes that would elucidate a potential role of Middle module subunits in Mediator localization and transcriptional repression . Thus , we were particularly interested in deletion mutants that had synthetic interactions with the GENE1 ts mutant ( Middle module ) , but not the GENE2 ts mutant ( Head module ) . All gene deletions that showed interactions with our mutants ( Figures 3 and 4 ) and all gene deletions lacking an interaction ( Tables 2 and 3 ) were confirmed by random spore analysis .

Although many Mediator subunits encoded by non-essential genes have been subjected to comprehensive study by synthetic genetic array screening , or ' E-MAP ' analysis ( 44 ) , considerably less is known about the genetic interactions of the subunits encoded by essential genes . In the previous ' E-MAP ' analysis a ' decreased abundance by messenger RNA perturbation ' ( DAmP ) approach was used to decrease the abundance of several mRNAs encoding essential Mediator subunits ( 44 ) to search for synthetic phenotype interactions with a deletion library . It is unclear whether this approach will be generally applicable to Mediator subunits as the synthetic interactions of MED16(SIN4)-DamP allele showed very little overlap with a deletion mutant of this same non-essential subunit ( 44 ) . Furthermore , the analysis of genetic interactions in the ' E-MAP ' study ( 44 ) was restricted to a functionally biased subset of genes . A previous SGA analysis of an essential subunit of TFIID , TAF9 , had shown the utility of using ts mutants in studying genetic interactions of components of transcription complexes ( 51 ) . Our study used temperature sensitive mutants of two essential Mediator subunits , OTHER_GENE and OTHER_GENE , and tested for synthetic interactions in an unbiased , genome-wide manner using the yeast deletion library at the permissive temperature . This methodology generated a number of interesting observations . First , both our mutants exhibited synthetic growth defect phenotypes when combined with deletion mutants in other members of the Mediator complex . This is similar to interactions observed for Mediator deletion mutants ( 44 ) . Akin to previously analyzed deletion mutants , both of our Mediator ts mutants also showed a strong synthetic growth phenotype with deletion mutants in GENE1 and members of the SWR-C complex . The Middle module mutant subunit , OTHER_GENE ts , also showed a strong synthetic growth defect with deletion of TFIIS ( OTHER_GENE ) , while the Head module subunit , med8 ts did not . TFIIS is involved in multiple aspects of transcription including elongation . This is again consistent with the previously observed strong genetic interaction between the Mediator Middle module and GENE2 . Cumulatively , these interactions and others ( Figures 3 and 4 ) demonstrate that ts mutants in Mediator subunits can discover a large number of bona fide genetic interactions .

Since a goal of our work was to understand the how the Middle module subunits impact the properties of the entire Mediator complex , we focused on the GENE1 ts genetic interactions and found a small set of unique interactions compared to the med8 ts . When compared to the published E-MAP data set ( 44 ) , the list of deletions that show synthetic interactions with the GENE1 ts are most similar to the Middle module query mutants [ Deltamed9(cse2 ) , Deltamed31(soh1 ) and Deltamed1 ] , and also have some similarity to the deletion of subunits on the Tail/Middle module interface [ Deltamed16(sin4 ) and Deltamed5(nut1 ) ] . The synthetic growth defect observed between the GENE1 ts , and OTHER_GENE , GENE2 and OTHER_GENE were of particular interest . The Hda1 complex and Hst2 , are in the histone deacetylase family of proteins and have been implicated in transcriptional silencing and repression through chromatin facilitated mechanisms ( 48,49 ) . The deletion of Med16(Sin4 ) and Med5(Nut1 ) , two subunits also strongly implicated in transcriptional repression via chromatin ( 13,32 ) , are the only other Mediator mutants to show a synthetic growth defect with OTHER_GENE . Although suggestive of a chromatin based function for Mediator , the synthetic interactions with OTHER_GENE , GENE2 and OTHER_GENE alone can not tell us whether the Mediator mutants and the HDAC mutants are both in a pathway regulating chromatin interactions . The strong negative correlation in synthetic interactions possessed by GENE1 ts ( and other core Mediator mutants ) compared with those possessed by members of the Cdk8 module supports the idea that the core and Cdk8 modules of Mediator function through different repression mechanisms ( 19 ) .

Since a goal of our work was to understand the how the Middle module subunits impact the properties of the entire Mediator complex , we focused on the GENE1 ts genetic interactions and found a small set of unique interactions compared to the med8 ts . When compared to the published E-MAP data set ( 44 ) , the list of deletions that show synthetic interactions with the GENE1 ts are most similar to the Middle module query mutants [ Deltamed9(cse2 ) , Deltamed31(soh1 ) and Deltamed1 ] , and also have some similarity to the deletion of subunits on the Tail/Middle module interface [ Deltamed16(sin4 ) and Deltamed5(nut1 ) ] . The synthetic growth defect observed between the GENE1 ts , and GENE2 , OTHER_GENE and OTHER_GENE were of particular interest . The Hda1 complex and Hst2 , are in the histone deacetylase family of proteins and have been implicated in transcriptional silencing and repression through chromatin facilitated mechanisms ( 48,49 ) . The deletion of Med16(Sin4 ) and Med5(Nut1 ) , two subunits also strongly implicated in transcriptional repression via chromatin ( 13,32 ) , are the only other Mediator mutants to show a synthetic growth defect with GENE2 .

To address whether OTHER_GENE and OTHER_GENE genetically interact with each other , we compared the growth of the OTHER_GENE - GENE1 mutant to the trs65Delta and GENE2 - GENE1 mutants at 25 and 29 C. Growth was monitored by seeding ~100 cells on yeast extract/peptone/dextrose ( YPD ) plates or spotting serial dilutions of cells on YPD plates .

One possible explanation for the severe growth defect in the trs65Deltagea1 - GENE1 triple mutant is that the loss of OTHER_GENE exacerbates trafficking defects in the OTHER_GENE - GENE1 mutant . Because TRAPPII is required for the recycling of GFP-Snc1p ( Cai et al. , 2005 ) , we compared the recycling of GFP-Snc1p in the OTHER_GENE - GENE1 and trs65Deltagea1 - GENE1 mutants . GENE2 is a vesicle SNARE that is incorporated into secretory vesicles at the late Golgi . After secretory vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane , GENE2 is constitutively endocytosed and traffics back to the late Golgi via the early endosome ( Lewis et al. , 2000 ) . Similar to wild-type cells , GFP-Snc1p was mostly localized to the plasma membrane in the trs65Deltagea1 - GENE1 mutant at the permissive temperature ( 25 C ) . However , after the cells were shifted to 37 C for 5 min , GFP-Snc1p was found in punctate or diffuse structures in ~71 % of trs65Deltagea1 - GENE1 mutant cells but only ~29 % of the OTHER_GENE - GENE1 mutant cells ( Figure 5 , A and B ) . Thus , the loss of OTHER_GENE in the OTHER_GENE - GENE1 ts mutant exacerbates both the growth and trafficking defect that results from the loss of OTHER_GENE . We also examined the consequences of disrupting OTHER_GENE in a gea2Delta mutant . While the loss of either OTHER_GENE or OTHER_GENE did not significantly disrupt GENE2 recycling , we observed a GFP-Snc1p trafficking defect in ~83 % of the trs65Deltagea2Delta mutant cells that were shifted to 37 C for 1 h ( Supplemental Figure S2 ) . Although more trs65Deltagea2Delta cells displayed a trafficking defect than trs65Deltagea1 - GENE1 mutant cells , the defect in the trs65Deltagea1 - GENE1 mutant was more severe . Together , these findings imply that OTHER_GENE and OTHER_GENE functionally interact with each other . In addition , our data imply that OTHER_GENE plays a role in traffic from the early endosome to the late Golgi in yeast .

However , after the cells were shifted to 37 C for 5 min , GFP-Snc1p was found in punctate or diffuse structures in ~71 % of trs65Deltagea1 - OTHER_GENE mutant cells but only ~29 % of the OTHER_GENE - OTHER_GENE mutant cells ( Figure 5 , A and B ) . Thus , the loss of GENE1 in the OTHER_GENE - OTHER_GENE ts mutant exacerbates both the growth and trafficking defect that results from the loss of OTHER_GENE . We also examined the consequences of disrupting GENE1 in a gea2Delta mutant . While the loss of either OTHER_GENE or OTHER_GENE did not significantly disrupt GENE2 recycling , we observed a GFP-Snc1p trafficking defect in ~83 % of the trs65Deltagea2Delta mutant cells that were shifted to 37 C for 1 h ( Supplemental Figure S2 ) . Although more trs65Deltagea2Delta cells displayed a trafficking defect than trs65Deltagea1 - OTHER_GENE mutant cells , the defect in the trs65Deltagea1 - OTHER_GENE mutant was more severe . Together , these findings imply that OTHER_GENE and OTHER_GENE functionally interact with each other . In addition , our data imply that OTHER_GENE plays a role in traffic from the early endosome to the late Golgi in yeast .
One possible explanation for the severe growth defect in the trs65Deltagea1 - OTHER_GENE triple mutant is that the loss of GENE1 exacerbates trafficking defects in the OTHER_GENE - OTHER_GENE mutant . Because TRAPPII is required for the recycling of GFP-Snc1p ( Cai et al. , 2005 ) , we compared the recycling of GFP-Snc1p in the OTHER_GENE - OTHER_GENE and trs65Deltagea1 - OTHER_GENE mutants . OTHER_GENE is a vesicle SNARE that is incorporated into secretory vesicles at the late Golgi .

To determine whether GENE1 works in conjunction with Trs120p to facilitate COPI localization , we deleted TRS65 in the OTHER_GENE - 2 and OTHER_GENE - 4 mutants and examined the localization of gamma-COP ( Sec21p-GFP ) . As previously reported ( Cai et al. , 2005 ) , Sec21p-GFP is mislocalized in the OTHER_GENE - 2 and OTHER_GENE - 4 mutants ( Figure 6A ) . Although COPI was not significantly mislocalized in the GENE2 mutant , the COPI mislocalization defect in the OTHER_GENE - 2 and OTHER_GENE - 4 mutants was exacerbated in these mutants in the absence of GENE1 ( Figure 6A ) . COPI was mislocalized in ~24 % of the OTHER_GENE - 2 cells , and this number increased to ~38 % in the absence of GENE1 . In the OTHER_GENE - 4 mutant , COPI was mislocalized in ~19 % of the cells , and this number increased to 32 % in the absence of Gea2p ( Figure 6B ) . The defect in COPI localization was specific , as the integrity of the early ( GFP-Vrg4p ) and late ( Sec7p-GFP ) Golgi appeared to be unaffected in the double mutants ( Figure 6A ) . Together our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that GENE1 works in conjunction with Trs120p and Gea2p to facilitate COPI localization .

Because we initially identified GENE1 and OTHER_GENE in a screen for canavanine-resistant mutants ( Figure 1 , B and C , and Table 1 ) , we reasoned that mutations that impair Can1 recycling would confer canavanine resistance in ESCRT-mutant cells , such as OTHER_GENE cells lacking ESCRT-III function . Consistent with this idea , deletion of GENE2 rescued the canavanine-sensitive phenotype of OTHER_GENE cells ( snx41Delta OTHER_GENE double-mutant cells ; Figure 2D ; Teis et al. , 2010 ) . Of interest , we found that loss of GENE1 conferred a canavanine-resistant phenotype in snf7Delta-mutant cells ( ere1Delta OTHER_GENE double-mutant cells ; Figure 2D ) , consistent with a role for GENE1 in Can1 recycling .

Previous reports demonstrated that the Snx4/41/42 and retromer complexes function in two separate pathways that mediate the recycling of different cargoes ( such as Snc1 and Vps10 , respectively ) from endosomes . However , our initial data indicated that both the Snx4/41/42 and retromer complexes are involved in the recycling of the cell-surface protein Can1 . So we next examined whether these two complexes function independently or together to recycle Can1 . To establish whether the Snx4/41/42 and the retromer complexes function independently to recycle Can1 , we created several double- and triple-deletion mutants of genes encoding the Snx4/41/42 and retromer complexes . The retromer complex consists of OTHER_GENE , Vps17 , Vps35 , Vps26 , and Vps29 . In addition , the OTHER_GENE adaptor protein functions in the retromer pathway to mediate endosome-to-Golgi trafficking of the cell-surface iron transporter Ftr1 ( Strochlic et al. , 2007 ) . We tested multiple combinations : OTHER_GENE OTHER_GENE , GENE1 OTHER_GENE OTHER_GENE , GENE1 OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE OTHER_GENE , GENE1 OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE OTHER_GENE , and GENE1 OTHER_GENE : to examine the consequence of loss of the retromer and Snx4/41/42 complexes . Consistent with previous findings that OTHER_GENE and OTHER_GENE function in the same pathway whereas GENE2 , OTHER_GENE , and OTHER_GENE function in another , OTHER_GENE OTHER_GENE double-mutant cells and GENE1 OTHER_GENE OTHER_GENE triple-mutant cells did not display increased canavanine-resistant phenotypes as compared with their corresponding single-deletion mutants ( Figure 3A and Table 1 ) . However , OTHER_GENE OTHER_GENE , GENE1 OTHER_GENE , and GENE1 OTHER_GENE double-mutant cells show enhanced canavanine-resistant phenotypes due to loss of both the Snx4/41/42 and retromer pathways ( Figure 3A and Table 1 ) .

However , our initial data indicated that both the Snx4/41/42 and retromer complexes are involved in the recycling of the cell-surface protein Can1 . So we next examined whether these two complexes function independently or together to recycle Can1 .

Previous reports demonstrated that the Snx4/41/42 and retromer complexes function in two separate pathways that mediate the recycling of different cargoes ( such as Snc1 and Vps10 , respectively ) from endosomes . However , our initial data indicated that both the Snx4/41/42 and retromer complexes are involved in the recycling of the cell-surface protein Can1 . So we next examined whether these two complexes function independently or together to recycle Can1 . To establish whether the Snx4/41/42 and the retromer complexes function independently to recycle Can1 , we created several double- and triple-deletion mutants of genes encoding the Snx4/41/42 and retromer complexes . The retromer complex consists of OTHER_GENE , Vps17 , Vps35 , Vps26 , and Vps29 . In addition , the OTHER_GENE adaptor protein functions in the retromer pathway to mediate endosome-to-Golgi trafficking of the cell-surface iron transporter Ftr1 ( Strochlic et al. , 2007 ) .

In wild-type cells , internalized OTHER_GENE can be either delivered to the vacuole for degradation or recycled back to the PM . Thus impaired recycling of OTHER_GENE would lead to increased rates of degradation . So we measured the lifetimes of OTHER_GENE in wild-type and various recycling-deficient cells under conditions that stimulate OTHER_GENE internalization . Consistent with our previous results , the degradation of Can1-FLAG in GENE1 , snx3Delta , and GENE2 mutant cells is slightly increased as compared with wild-type rates ( Figure 3C ) . In addition , the lifetime of OTHER_GENE in snx3Delta GENE2 double-deletion-mutant cells is similar to that of GENE2 and snx3Delta single-mutant cells , consistent with the model that Ere1 and Snx3 function in a common pathway . In contrast , the degradation of Can1-FLAG in GENE1 GENE2 double-mutant cells is significantly increased as compared with GENE2 and GENE1 single-mutant cells ( Figure 3C ) . Taken together , these data further suggest that the Ere-mediated retromer and Snx4/41/42 pathways function independently to recycle OTHER_GENE .

Rates of heteroallelic recombination in the HIS1 locus ( his1 - 1/his1 - 7 ) in diploid mgs1/mgs1 cells complemented with two copies of OTHER_GENE or OTHER_GENE * as indicated . The empty vector served as control . Error bars indicate standard deviations . ( C ) The UBZ domain is irrelevant for the synthetic lethality of GENE2 OTHER_GENE mutants . Shown are progeny of genetic crosses between GENE2 and OTHER_GENE mutants , each carrying an empty vector , OTHER_GENE or OTHER_GENE * as indicated . Tetrads are aligned in perpendicular orientation . ( D ) The UBZ domain is irrelevant for the synthetic growth defect of OTHER_GENE OTHER_GENE mutants . Growth of the indicated strains on rich medium was monitored by spot assays . ( E ) Overexpression of OTHER_GENE sensitizes cells to DNA damage and replication problems in a UBZ-dependent manner . Spot assays for sensitivity to MMS and hydroxyurea ( HU ) at the indicated concentrations were performed with WT cells carrying vectors for overexpression of OTHER_GENE alleles under control of a galactose-inducible promoter ( Gal-MGS1 and Gal-MGS1 * ) . The empty vector served as control . ( F ) Overexpression of OTHER_GENE suppresses DNA damage-induced mutagenesis in a UBZ-dependent manner . Frequencies of MMS-induced mutations in the CAN1 locus were determined for WT strains harbouring Gal-MGS1 or Gal-MGS1*. The empty vector served as control . Error bars represent standard deviations from three independent measurements . ( G ) Suppression of the temperature sensitivity of OTHER_GENE by overexpression of OTHER_GENE requires catalytic activity , but not the UBZ domain . Overexpression was achieved by means of episomal ( 2 micro ) vectors with the OTHER_GENE promoter . Growth at 25 C and 37 C was monitored by spot assays . ( H ) Inactivation of the GENE1 UBZ domain is sufficient to suppress the damage sensitivity of OTHER_GENE mutants . Sensitivity of the indicated strains to MMS was assessed by spot assays .
Inactivation of OTHER_GENE causes a moderate reduction in life span ( 19 ) . While we were able to demonstrate this ageing phenotype for the GENE1 deletion , mutation of the UBZ domain had no adverse effect ( Figure 1A ) . Likewise , an elevated rate of spontaneous heteroallelic interchromosomal recombination , observable in diploid mgs1/mgs1 mutants ( 18,20 ) , was not detectable in an MGS1*/MGS1 * strain ( Figure 1B ) . Finally , the OTHER_GENE * allele was as efficient as WT OTHER_GENE in rescuing the synthetic lethality of a OTHER_GENE GENE1 double mutant ( 26 ) ( Figure 1C ) and the slight synthetic growth defect of an GENE2 GENE1 strain ( 25 ) ( Figure 1D ) , indicating that the UBZ domain does not contribute to either of these aspects of OTHER_GENE function .

These results indicated that ubiquitin binding is involved in some , but not all activities of Mgs1 , but they did not differentiate whether the UBZ domain specifically affects damage-related functions or rather those that require overexpression . This issue was addressed by examining additional phenotypes that would uncouple the two effects . On one hand , GENE1 overexpression has previously been shown to suppress the temperature sensitivity of a truncation mutant of OTHER_GENE , a nuclease/helicase involved in Okazaki fragment processing ( dna2Delta405N ) , in a damage-independent fashion ( 35 ) . Figure 1 G shows that GENE1 * , in contrast to the catalytically inactive mutant mgs1(K183A ) , was functional in this assay . On the other hand , deletion of GENE1 is known to suppress the DNA damage sensitivity of strains lacking the non-essential subunit of polymerase delta , GENE2 ( 20 ) . In this assay , inactivation of the UBZ domain had the same effect as an mgs1 deletion ( Figure 1H ) . Hence , the conditions under which GENE1 * exhibits defects correlate with the presence of exogenous DNA damage , but not with overexpression . Taken together , our data therefore support the idea that ubiquitin binding is important for those , and only those activities of Mgs1 related to the presence of exogenous DNA damage .

Given that physical interactions between Mgs1 and PCNA have been reported ( 21 ) , and PCNA is ubiquitylated in response to DNA damage , we asked whether the remarkable damage dependence of the UBZ-associated Mgs1 activities was related to PCNA modification . To address this question , we examined the effect of MGS1 or MGS1 * overexpression in mutants defective in various aspects of the RAD6 pathway . In pol30(K164R ) and OTHER_GENE mutants , which are both completely devoid of damage-dependent PCNA ubiquitylation at K164 ( 6 ) , the sensitization to MMS by overexpression of MGS1 was no longer observed , indicating that PCNA is indeed the ubiquitylation target relevant for the UBZ-dependent functions of Mgs1 ( Figure 2A ) . Neither selective abolishment of polyubiquitylation ( by deletion of GENE1 ) nor inactivation of all three GENE2 polymerases ( rad30 rev1 rev3 , designated as tlsDelta ) was sufficient to abrogate the sensitizing effect of MGS1 overexpression , but the simultaneous inactivation of GENE1 and the GENE2 polymerases resulted in a situation comparable to the OTHER_GENE deletion ( Figure 2B ) . Hence , the negative action of MGS1 relies on a combined effect on both branches of the RAD6 pathway .

IL-2 is regulated by multiple transcription factors and chromatin modifications [ 38,39 ] . We tested the effects of GENE1 and GENE2 on the transactivating potential of two major IL-2 transcriptional regulators , NFkappaB and NFAT . In these experiments , the reporter construct contains a luciferase gene that is regulated by three tandem repeats of either the NFkappaB consensus sequence from the MHC class I promoter [ 40 ] or the NFAT binding site from the human IL-2 gene promoter [ 41 ] . Consistent with published reports and shown in Figure 8 , GENE2 inhibits NFkappaB [ 13 ] and NFAT [ 13,22 ] transactivation potential in Jurkat T cells . Siva repressed NFkappaB ( Figure 8A ) , but had no effect on NFAT activity ( Figure 8B ) . The combination of GENE2 and GENE1 repressed NFkappaB activity more than GENE2 alone . Even though the NFkappaB repressive effect of the two genes in combination was slight ( ~20 % ) , the effect was reproducible with statistical significance .
Our analysis of two IL-2 transactivators supports the assertion that GENE1 and GENE2 affect shared and different IL-2 regulatory mechanisms . Consistent with previous reports , GENE2 repressed NFkappaB [ 22 ] and NFAT [ 13,22 ] transactivation reporters . GENE1 inhibited NFkappaB , but had no effect on NFAT in cells stimulated with PMA and Ionomycin . We observed a small , but significant additive repressive effect between GENE2 and GENE1 on NFkappaB activity .
To conclude , we have carried out an analysis of IL-2 gene regulation by GENE1 and GENE2 in Jurkat T cell lines . GENE1 and GENE2 both repress IL-2 gene expression independently , though the repressive effect of GENE1 appears to be dominant over GENE2 in both assays used here . We have shown that GENE1 and GENE2 appear to have a slight , but significant , additive repressive effect on NFkappaB activity . Many questions remain , most importantly , those regarding GENE2 's contribution to Treg development and function . Additional efforts are needed to address these intriguing possibilities .
The kinetochore ( centromeric DNA and associated proteins ) is a key determinant for high fidelity chromosome transmission . Evolutionarily conserved Scm3p is an essential component of centromeric chromatin and is required for assembly and function of kinetochores in humans , fission yeast , and budding yeast . Overexpression of HJURP , the mammalian homolog of budding yeast Scm3p , has been observed in lung and breast cancers and is associated with poor prognosis ; however , the physiological relevance of these observations is not well understood . We overexpressed SCM3 and HJURP in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and HJURP in human cells and defined domains within Scm3p that mediate its chromosome loss phenotype . Our results showed that the overexpression of SCM3 ( OTHER_GENE ) or HJURP ( GALHJURP ) caused chromosome loss in a wild-type yeast strain , and overexpression of HJURP led to mitotic defects in human cells . OTHER_GENE resulted in reduced viability in kinetochore mutants , premature separation of sister chromatids , and reduction in GENE1 and histone OTHER_GENE at centromeres . Overexpression of GENE2 or histone OTHER_GENE suppressed chromosome loss and restored levels of GENE1 at centromeres in OTHER_GENE strains . Using mutant alleles of scm3 , we identified a domain in the N-terminus of Scm3p that mediates its interaction with CEN DNA and determined that the chromosome loss phenotype of OTHER_GENE is due to centromeric association of Scm3p devoid of Cse4p/H4 . Furthermore , we determined that similar to other systems the centromeric association of Scm3p is cell cycle regulated . Our results show that altered stoichiometry of Scm3p/HJURP , GENE1 , and histone OTHER_GENE lead to defects in chromosome segregation . We conclude that stringent regulation of HJURP and SCM3 expression are critical for genome stability .

Scm3p directly binds and forms a stoichiometric complex with GENE1 and histone H4 , and is required for their assembly into centromeric chromatin [18]-[20 ] . Similarly , HJURP interacts stoichiometrically with CENP-A/H4 [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] . We reasoned that the chromosome loss phenotype of OTHER_GENE strains may be due to imbalanced stoichiometry between Scm3p and Cse4p/H4 . Hence , we determined the effect of overexpression of CSE4 in OTHER_GENE strains . Our results showed that OTHER_GENE suppressed the chromosome loss phenotype of OTHER_GENE strains ( Figure 1C ) . Previous studies have shown that overexpression of histone H4 ( GENE2 ) suppresses certain cse4 alleles [ 40 ] . Consistent with these observations , we found that GENE2 ( OTHER_GENE ) suppressed the chromosome loss phenotype of OTHER_GENE strains ( Figure 1C ) . We performed western blot analysis to determine if overexpression of Scm3p affects the levels of GENE1 , Histone H3 or Histone H4 . We found that OTHER_GENE strains show slightly higher levels of GENE1 , whereas levels of histone H3 or H4 are not affected in these strains ( Figure 1A ) . We also observed higher levels of GENE1 in strains co-expressing OTHER_GENE with either GENE2 or OTHER_GENE when compared to strains expressing OTHER_GENE or GENE2 alone ( Figure 1D ) . The increased levels of GENE1 in OTHER_GENE strains are consistent with a recent report describing a role for Scm3p in protecting GENE1 from ubiquitin-mediated degradation [ 41 ] . The increased levels of GENE1 in GENE2 strains can be explained by previous observations for genetic interactions between GENE1 and histone H4 [ 40 ] .
Scm3p directly binds and forms a stoichiometric complex with GENE1 and histone H4 , and is required for their assembly into centromeric chromatin [18]-[20 ] . Similarly , HJURP interacts stoichiometrically with CENP-A/H4 [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] . We reasoned that the chromosome loss phenotype of GENE2 strains may be due to imbalanced stoichiometry between Scm3p and Cse4p/H4 . Hence , we determined the effect of overexpression of CSE4 in GENE2 strains . Our results showed that OTHER_GENE suppressed the chromosome loss phenotype of GENE2 strains ( Figure 1C ) . Previous studies have shown that overexpression of histone H4 ( OTHER_GENE ) suppresses certain cse4 alleles [ 40 ] . Consistent with these observations , we found that OTHER_GENE ( OTHER_GENE ) suppressed the chromosome loss phenotype of GENE2 strains ( Figure 1C ) . We performed western blot analysis to determine if overexpression of Scm3p affects the levels of GENE1 , Histone H3 or Histone H4 . We found that GENE2 strains show slightly higher levels of GENE1 , whereas levels of histone H3 or H4 are not affected in these strains ( Figure 1A ) . We also observed higher levels of GENE1 in strains co-expressing GENE2 with either OTHER_GENE or OTHER_GENE when compared to strains expressing GENE2 or OTHER_GENE alone ( Figure 1D ) .

Based on the suppression of GALSCM3-induced chromosome loss phenotype by OTHER_GENE and OTHER_GENE , we hypothesized that excess Scm3p devoid of Cse4p/H4 may associate with CEN DNA . Hence , we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) experiments to measure the levels of CEN-bound GENE1 in SCM3 overexpressing ( GENE2 ) and vector strains . Consistent with our hypothesis , we observed that GENE2 strains showed about 3-fold reduction in the levels of GENE1 at both CEN1 ( 0.54 % of input ) and CEN3 ( 0.44 % ) compared to vector alone ( 1.50 % at CEN1 , and 1.48 % at CEN3 ) ( Figure 1E ) . CEN-bound H4 was also reduced in strains overexpressing SCM3 . ChIP results showed a 2- to 3-fold reduction in CEN-bound histone H4 in GENE2 ( 2.30 % at CEN1 , and 2.57 % at CEN3 ) than vector alone ( 5.61 % at CEN1 , and 4.22 % at CEN3 ) strains ( Figure 1F ) . Western blot analysis showed that the reduction in CEN-bound GENE1 or histone H4 in GENE2 strains was not due to reduced expression of GENE1 or histone H4 ( Figure 1A ) . Furthermore , CEN-associated GENE1 in the GENE2 strain was restored to wild-type levels in the presence of OTHER_GENE or OTHER_GENE ( Figure 1E ) . These results indicate that centromeric association of excess Scm3p devoid of Cse4p/H4 contributes to the chromosome loss phenotype in GENE2 strains .

The chromosome loss phenotype of OTHER_GENE strains may be due to compromised kinetochore function and hence , we examined genetic interactions between OTHER_GENE and genes encoding other kinetochore components , specifically subunits of the COMA and Ctf3p complexes . These proteins interact with Cse4p and are important for maintenance of kinetochore integrity [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] . OTHER_GENE showed reduced viability in a subset of the kinetochore mutants , with the most severe phenotype in the GENE1 strain ( Figure 4A ) . Deletion of MCM21 is known to cause defects in pericentromeric cohesion , leading to precocious separation of sister chromatids and premature initiation of anaphase [ 44 ] . Since OTHER_GENE showed the most severe phenotype in GENE1 strains , we examined if OTHER_GENE exacerbated the sister chromatid cohesion defect of GENE1 strains . We monitored the segregation of sister chromatids in metaphase cells by assaying the binding of GFP-LacI to operator sequences inserted 12-kb from the centromere ( pericentromere ) on Chromosome IV [ 44 ] . Wild-type strains arrested in metaphase show a predominance of cells with a single GFP-LacI focus marking two closely associated sister chromatids , whereas premature separation of sister chromatids results in the appearance of two GFP-LacI foci [ 44 ] . Consistent with previous findings , we observed a low incidence of two GFP-LacI foci in wild-type cells ( 5 % ) compared to that in GENE1 cells ( 26 % ) ( Figure 4B , 4C ) . Strains overexpressing SCM3 showed a higher incidence of two GFP-LacI foci in wild-type ( 16 % ) as well as GENE1 strains ( 39 % ) ( Figure 4B , 4C ) suggesting that overexpression of SCM3 enhances premature separation of sister chromatids . The higher incidence of two GFP-LacI foci was observed in mitotic cells but not in G1-arrested cells ( Figure 4B ) . GENE1 cells depend on the IPL1 biorientation checkpoint for viability [ 44 ] . Similarly , we found that OTHER_GENE leads to growth defects in the GENE2 - 321 strain but not in wild-type strains ( Figure 4D ) . Together , these results show that overexpression of SCM3 enhances premature separation of sister chromatids .

Overexpression of HJURP has been observed in mammalian cancer cell lines , such as lung and breast cancers [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] . Based on our results with OTHER_GENE , we tested if overexpression of HJURP leads to mitotic defects in yeast . We cloned HJURP into a yeast expression vector allowing regulated expression of the gene from a GAL1 promoter . A wild-type reporter strain overexpressing HJURP exhibits a chromosome loss phenotype ( 7.3 + -0.3 % ) similar to that observed for OTHER_GENE ( 8.9 + -0.8 % ) ( Figure 6A ) . GENE1 suppresses the chromosome loss phenotype of the GENE2 strain to the same extent as that observed for strains co-expressing OTHER_GENE and GENE1 ( Figure 6A ) . We confirmed galactose-induced expression of GENE2 by western blotting ( Figure 6B ) .

A wild-type reporter strain overexpressing HJURP exhibits a chromosome loss phenotype ( 7.3 + -0.3 % ) similar to that observed for GENE1 ( 8.9 + -0.8 % ) ( Figure 6A ) . GENE2 suppresses the chromosome loss phenotype of the OTHER_GENE strain to the same extent as that observed for strains co-expressing GENE1 and GENE2 ( Figure 6A ) . We confirmed galactose-induced expression of OTHER_GENE by western blotting ( Figure 6B ) .
Studies with human breast cancer cell lines and primary breast tumors have shown that GENE1 mRNA levels were significantly correlated with GENE2 mRNA levels [ 39 ] ; hence , we tested whether co-overexpression of GENE2 and GENE1 exacerbated the chromosome missegregation observed with GENE1 overexpression alone . Cells overexpressing GENE2 exhibited an increased incidence of lagging chromosomes ( 16 + -3 % ) compared with controls , not as severe as the effect of GENE1 overexpression . However , when GENE2 and GENE1 were co-overexpressed in the same cell , the incidence of micronuclei ( 32 + -18 % ) and lagging chromosomes ( 30 + -17 % ) was increased relative to GENE2 or GENE1 overexpression alone ( Figure 7B ) . Increased rates of chromosome loss with overexpression of both GENE2 and GENE1 are consistent with observations in breast cancer where there is a correlation between increased levels of GENE1 and GENE2 [ 39 ] . Overexpression of both GENE2 and GENE1 may result in stabilization of GENE1 ( Figure 7C ) . Alternatively , overexpression of GENE2 and GENE1 may independently lead to a phenotype that is more susceptible to acquiring a tumorigenic potential .
OTHER_GENE is an NAD-dependent deacetylase that targets histone H3 and H4 to promote rDNA silencing 16 . It is possible that the role of GENE1 in rDNA silencing ( Fig. 1b-e ) is fully mediated by OTHER_GENE function . To test this , we first investigated whether OTHER_GENE localises to IGS regions in the absence of GENE1 . We found that GENE1 inactivation reduced OTHER_GENE binding across IGS ( Fig. 2a ) . Next , we investigated whether GENE1 inactivation affected rDNA silencing in the absence of OTHER_GENE . We found increased IGS transcription in double mutant cells ( OTHER_GENE GENE2 - 1 ) compared to single mutants ( Fig. 2b ) , demonstrating that in the absence of OTHER_GENE , GENE1 supports silencing at IGS regions .

In addition to silencing , transcription of non-coding RNA within the IGS regions is also subject to degradation , a process mediated by the TRAMP complex and by the exosome 17 . Next we investigated whether increased IGS transcription in OTHER_GENE - 1 cells is caused by defects of this degradation pathway . To this aim , we deleted OTHER_GENE , the poly(A ) polymerase component of TRAMP4 , in OTHER_GENE - 1 cells and investigated IGS transcription in the presence and absence of GENE1 ( Fig. 2c ) . Double mutant GENE2 OTHER_GENE - 1 cells showed an increase in IGS transcription compared to single mutants ( Fig. 2c ) , which demonstrates that elevated IGS transcription in OTHER_GENE - 1 cells is not caused by defects in TRAMP-mediated degradation of ncRNA .

The severe synthetic growth defects caused by combination of alterations in the arm and HPD region suggested to us that the arm might play an important role in stabilizing the interaction of Pam18 with Pam16 and thus Pam18 's interaction with the translocon . To test this idea , we decided to assess the effect of HPD alterations when in combination with mutations previously shown to decrease the stability of Pam18 's interaction with the translocon . Our goal was to determine whether they showed the same or a different pattern of genetic interactions as the mutations causing alterations in Pam18 's arm . We choose two mutations for analysis : GENE1 and GENE2 - 60 . L97 of Pam16 is in the J-type domain and directly contacts Pam18 's J-domain ( Figure 1B ) ; alteration of this leucine to a tryptophan destabilizes the Pam18:Pam16 interaction ( D'silva et al. , 2008 ) . Like pam18F99G/F104 G cells , GENE1 cells are temperature sensitive for growth and do not form colonies at 37 C ( Figure 4A ) . However , the L97W mutation causes a slightly less severe growth defect . Although GENE1 grew as well as wt cells at 30 C , growth of pam18F99G/F104 G was slightly impaired at this temperature ( Table 1 ) . Pam18Delta1 - 60 was chosen because its phenotypic consequences are independent of possible confounding effects in the matrix , as it does not lack any matrix localized residues but , instead , only the IMS domain . Under typical laboratory conditions , GENE2 - 60 grows indistinguishably from wt cells ( Figure 4A ; Mokranjac et al. , 2007 ; D'silva et al. , 2008 ) , although it is synthetically lethal with the GENE1 mutation ( Supplemental Figure S4 ) , as expected of a mutation that affects the stability of the interaction of Pam18 with the translocon .
Because the in vitro experiments described earlier suggested that at least some residues between positions 25 and 54 are functionally important , we carried out an alanine scan to assess their importance in in vivo function ( Figure 5A ) . Changing three alanine residues at a time , we constructed eight mutants and used the plasmid-shuffling system to test for their ability to carry out Pam16 function . All mutants supported growth as well as wt PAM16 ( Supplemental Figure S5 ) . To test more rigorously the functional robustness of these Pam16 variants , we expressed them in cells expressing a Pam18 variant , Pam18L150W . Pam18L150W has an alteration in the J-domain at the interface with Pam16 ( Figure 1B ) , analogous to the L97W mutation of Pam16 used in the experiments described earlier ( D'silva et al. , 2005b , 2008 ) . However , the growth defect of OTHER_GENE cells is slightly less severe than that of pam16L97W , as they grow nearly as well as wt cells at 34 C ( D'silva et al. , 2008 ) . Again we used the plasmid-shuffling technique to assess synthetic genetic interactions . Six of the triple-alanine PAM16 mutants showed no synthetic growth defect with OTHER_GENE ( Figure 5C ) . On the other hand , those having substitutions at positions 48 - 50 ( OTHER_GENE - 50AAA ) and 51 - 53 ( GENE1 - 53AAA ) showed severe growth defects in combination with OTHER_GENE ( Figure 5C ) . Although OTHER_GENE - 50AAA OTHER_GENE cells could form colonies at 23 C , GENE1 - 53AAA and OTHER_GENE were synthetically lethal , indicating the functional importance of this interval . When the triple-alanine mutations were combined with the pam16L97W substitution , similar results were observed ( Figure 5D ) . Neither pam16L97W/48 - 50AAA nor pam16L97W/51 - 53AAA was able to rescue growth on 5-FOA plates , whereas the other triple-alanine mutants containing the L97W alteration grew like the pam16L97W single mutant ( Figure 5D ) . To test the importance of these individual residues , mutations were made to create single-alanine substitutions at positions G48 , E49 , Y50 , G51 , G52 , and I53 . Each mutant was then tested in the OTHER_GENE genetic background . Most of the genetic interactions were relatively minor ( Figure 5E ) . However , GENE2 was synthetically lethal with OTHER_GENE , indicating the particular importance of this residue .

A previous study demonstrated that overexpression of MAP1B by in utero electroporation revealed an impaired radial migration in developing cortical neurons ( 26 ) . Similar to the findings of a previous study , radial migration was severely impaired by GENE1 alone , but coexpression of GENE2 completely rescued the LC1-mediated impaired migration ( Fig. S6A ) . We examined the effects of GENE2 knockdown on cortical migration and cell viability by a specific shRNA . GENE2 knockdown induced a severe defect in cortical migration ( Fig. 4A ) and TUNEL-positive cell death ( Fig. 4B ) . Statistical analyses are shown in Fig. S6 B and C , respectively . Co-knockdown of GENE1 rescued the migration disorder and cell death observed in MITOL-knockdown cells , suggesting that impaired cortical migration and cell death by GENE2 knockdown is , at least in part , the result of GENE1 accumulation . Thus , GENE2 appears to block LC1-mediated cytotoxicity in vivo .
Overexpression of Yeast GENE1 Restores Chaperone Function of GENE2 Pf-CL .
Overexpression of GENE1 rescues deficient chaperone activity of GENE2 charged linker mutants . ( A ) Yeast cells expressing indicated His-yHSP90 constructs were lysed , and proteins were precipitated by Ni-NTA ; associating endogenous GENE1 was detected by immunoblotting . ( B ) ATPase activities of purified wild-type and indicated mutant GENE2 proteins were determined in the presence of 20 muM GENE1 protein . Geldanamycin ( GA , 10 muM ) was added to confirm HSP90 as the sole source of ATP hydrolysis in the assay . Data are expressed as fold activation ( compared with samples with no GENE1 added ) and are depicted as the mean + - SD derived from three independent experiments . ( C and D ) v-Src was transformed into cells that did or did not express exogenous GENE1 ( as indicated ) and also expressed either wild-type ( Wt ) or indicated mutant GENE2 constructs . ( C ) v-Src protein expression and activity were detected by immunoblotting ; ( D ) v-Src activity was also monitored by its negative effect on cell growth .
GENE1 mutations that showed impaired nucleic acid binding also exhibited genetic interactions with other mRNA export factors in vivo . Both the GENE2 - 5 ts allele or the yra1-DeltaRRM allele produce viable cells at 30 C. However , synthetic lethality was observed when either allele was combined with GENE1 mutant alleles impaired in nucleic acid binding ( Fig. 5f ) . Although Sac3250 - 563-K509D impaired RNA binding in vitro ( Fig. 4j , k ) , this was not sufficiently severe to generate a growth defect in vivo and showed only a small export defect ( Fig. 5d , e ) . However , this allele was synthetically lethal with yra1-DeltaRRM , but not with GENE2 - 5 ( Fig. 5f ) . These data suggests that in vivo the milder RNA binding defect exerted by the sac3-K509D allele is linked to the function of Yra1 in the export pathway . Overall the in vivo data with the mutants that impaired RNA binding indicate a synergy between the TREX-2 mediated nucleic acid binding function and the Mex67-Yra1 dependent mRNA export pathway .

Since overexpression of the TFAP2C-Myc-KDM5B complex induced G1/S transition in cycling cells , we next investigated whether the complex could also affect activation of CDKN1A at the S-phase or G2/M checkpoints induced by treatment with hydroxyurea ( HU ) or vinblastine , respectively . We first assayed the effects on endogenous protein expression after drug treatment for 24 and 48 h in MCF-7 cells . Induction of CDKN1A mRNA and protein was observed with both drugs in concert with upregulation of p53 levels ( Fig. 8A and B ) . Expression of GENE1 and OTHER_GENE was generally downregulated following treatment with vinblastine or HU , both at the mRNA and protein levels ( Fig. 8A and data not shown ) , although levels of GENE2 remained more constant . The binding of each protein to the proximal region of the CDKN1A promoter was assessed by ChIP assays with drug-treated cells and showed that treatment for 24 or 48 h reduced binding of all three factors to the CDKN1A locus ( Fig. 8C ) . This demonstrates that drug activation of the endogenous CDKN1A gene was accompanied by reduced expression of OTHER_GENE and GENE1 and coordinate release of these transcriptional repressors from the proximal promoter .

Since GENE1 repression of CDKN1A does not involve heterodimerization with Max or direct DNA binding ( 12 ) , a number of studies have looked at the requirement of GENE1 to access the promoter through interaction with other DNA binding proteins , particularly Sp1 and Miz-1 . The precise mechanism remains unclear , possibly because more than one pathway is active , with cell type-specific factors undoubtedly playing a role ( reviewed in reference 17 ) . Here we have explored the interdependence of GENE1 and GENE2 . Investigating the binding of these proteins at the endogenous CDKN1A gene in silenced MCF-7 cells by ChIP ( Fig. 6 ) revealed that each factor appeared to stabilize and/or facilitate the binding of the other to the proximal promoter . This was partly recreated using reporter assays where maximal repression by all three factors could be achieved only on promoter constructs with an intact AP-2 binding site ( Fig. 5 ) . Taking the ChIP and reporter assay data together , therefore , this suggests that GENE2 and GENE1 interact with the CDKN1A locus at separate sites , with only the AP-2 site at -111/-103 for GENE2 defined , and together they recruit the histone demethylase KDM5B to form a repressive ternary complex required for optimal downregulation of CDKN1A ( Fig. 9 , diagram ) . Interestingly , a similar mutual interdependence has recently been suggested to allow the stable binding of both GENE2 and FoxA1 to specific chromatin sites , leading to the recruitment of ERalpha and estrogen-responsive gene expression in breast cell lines ( 33 ) .
We explored the possibility that GENE1 and GENE2 upregulation might account for the enhanced reprogramming observed following Dot1L inhibition , and validated their upregulation in OTHER_GENE fibroblasts upon OSM or OS transduction ( Supplementary Fig. 13a , b ) . Interestingly , at this early time-point Rex1 and Dnmt3b , two other well-characterized pluripotency genes , were not upregulated suggesting that Dot1L inhibition does not broadly upregulate the pluripotency network . Suppression of either GENE1 or GENE2 abrogated the 2-factor ( OS ) reprogramming of OTHER_GENE fibroblasts , indicating the essential roles of GENE1 and GENE2 in this process ( Fig. 3c , Supplementary Fig. 13c ) . Dot1L inhibition also led to increased GENE1 expression in the context of Oct4 , Sox2 and GENE2 ( OSL ) and GENE2 expression in the context of Oct4 , Sox2 and GENE1 ( OSN ) ( Supplementary Fig. 14a ) . Furthermore , Dot1L inhibition significantly increased the efficiency of three-factor reprogramming in the context of OSN and OSL ( Supplementary Fig. 14b ) . Finally , inclusion of GENE1 and GENE2 in the OSKM reprogramming cocktail did not confer any additional enhancement to OTHER_GENE cells ( Fig. 4d , Supplementary Fig. 14c ) . Taken together , these data implicate GENE1 and GENE2 in the enhancement of reprogramming and replacement of Klf4 and c-Myc with Dot1L inhibition .

Wild-type and GENE1 - 4 cells were released from a G1 arrest and shifted to the restrictive temperature at 30 min after release , which was before bud growth had been initiated . Growth of a new bud was blocked in GENE1 - 4 cells because membrane traffic is required for bud growth . OTHER_GENE cleavage failed to occur in GENE1 - 4 cells , which indicated that they arrested before anaphase ( Fig. 1 A ) . To determine whether the arrest was caused by Swe1-dependent inhibitory phosphorylation of Cdk1 , we also assayed OTHER_GENE cleavage in GENE1 - 4 GENE2 cells ( Fig. 1 A ) . The extent and timing of OTHER_GENE cleavage were similar in wild-type and GENE1 - 4 GENE2 cells , which revealed that GENE2 caused complete checkpoint failure . As expected , the GENE1 - 4 cells arrested with a single nucleus , whereas the GENE1 - 4 GENE2 cells underwent nuclear division within the unbudded mother cell to form binucleate cells ( Fig. 1 B ) .

To further characterize the arrest , we analyzed accumulation of the mitotic cyclin OTHER_GENE . The GENE1 - 4 mutant caused a severe delay in OTHER_GENE accumulation that was rescued by GENE2 ( Fig. 1 C ) . We also analyzed mitotic spindles . In budding yeast , assembly of a short mitotic spindle is initiated in early mitosis by a low level of mitotic Cdk1 activity ( Rahal and Amon , 2008 ) . During anaphase , the spindle elongates to segregate the chromosomes . The GENE1 - 4 mutant caused delayed and reduced assembly of short spindles as well as a complete block to spindle elongation ( Fig. 1 , D and E ) . OTHER_GENE levels remained elevated , and long spindles did not disassemble normally in GENE1 - 4 GENE2 cells , which may be caused by a checkpoint that prevents exit from mitosis when cytokinesis is blocked by a checkpoint that monitors spindle orientation in the daughter bud ( Balasubramanian et al. , 2000 ; Pereira et al. , 2000 ) . Membrane traffic is required for cytokinesis ( Xu et al. , 2002 ) .

Wild-type , GENE1 - 4 , and GENE1 - 4 cdk1-Y19F cells were released from a G1 arrest and shifted to the restrictive temperature at 30 min after release . The dephosphorylation of GENE2 that normally occurs during entry into mitosis failed to occur normally in GENE1 - 4 cells ( Fig. 2 A ) . Limited dephosphorylation of GENE2 occurred in GENE1 - 4 cdk1-Y19F cells , but it was delayed and diminished . Swe1 underwent partial hyperphosphorylation in GENE1 - 4 and GENE1 - 4 cdk1-Y19F cells but failed to undergo the normal full hyperphosphorylation that is associated with inactivation of Swe1 ( Fig. 2 B ) . It also failed to undergo destruction . The partial phosphorylation of Swe1 observed in GENE1 - 4 and GENE1 - 4 cdk1-Y19F cells likely corresponds to the initial activation of Swe1 by Cdk1 that occurs during entry into mitosis ( Harvey et al. , 2005 , 2011 ) .
Previous work found that overexpression of Zds2 can override the checkpoint arrest caused by depolymerization of actin ( Yasutis et al. , 2010 ) . The ability of Zds2 to override the checkpoint was dependent on Cdc55 , which indicated that it works through PP2ACdc55 ( Yasutis et al. , 2010 ) . We found that overexpression of GENE1 drove cells through the checkpoint arrest caused by blocking membrane traffic , as revealed by cleavage of OTHER_GENE ( Fig. 5 A ) . Moreover , overexpression of GENE1 in checkpoint-arrested cells caused dephosphorylation of GENE2 and hyperphosphorylation of OTHER_GENE ( Fig. 5 , B and C ) . These observations suggest that PP2ACdc55 coordinately regulates OTHER_GENE and GENE2 and that Zds1/2 are key regulators of the checkpoint functions of PP2ACdc55 . An attractive model is that Zds1/2 coordinately regulate OTHER_GENE and GENE2 by shifting the activity of PP2ACdc55 away from OTHER_GENE to GENE2 . This could initiate full hyperphosphorylation and inactivation of OTHER_GENE as well as dephosphorylation of GENE2 , which is likely necessary for GENE2 activation .

We first screened the collection of alleles for mutants that affect mitosis . We reasoned that if Pkc1 relays signals that inactivate Swe1 or activate Mih1 , loss of Pkc1 could cause cells to become elongated because mitotic GENE1 suppresses polar bud growth ( Booher et al. , 1993 ; Lew and Reed , 1995b ; Ma et al. , 1996 ) . Five OTHER_GENE mutants caused a significant fraction of cells to become elongated when grown at semirestrictive temperatures . In each case , the elongated cell phenotype was eliminated by GENE2 , which indicated that it was caused by a failure to control GENE1 inhibitory phosphorylation . The strongest phenotype was observed in OTHER_GENE - 14 cells grown at a semirestrictive temperature of 30 C. The elongated phenotype became severe when cells were grown to high density , which suggests that OTHER_GENE - 14 compromises functions of Pkc1 that are important when growth is slowed by nutrient limitation ( Fig. 6 B ) . OTHER_GENE - 14 was recessive to wild-type PKC1 .

We next analyzed the effects of a PKC1 gain-of-function allele . A constitutively active form of OTHER_GENE ( referred to as OTHER_GENE * ) can be created by mutating an autoinhibitory phosphorylation site ( Watanabe et al. , 1994 ) . Expression of OTHER_GENE * from the GAL1 promoter caused rapid dephosphorylation of GENE1 ( Fig. 7 A ) . OTHER_GENE * did not cause dephosphorylation of GENE1 in cells carrying a temperature-sensitive allele of OTHER_GENE ( cdc55 - 4 ) , which demonstrated that it acts via GENE2 ( Fig. 7 B ) . OTHER_GENE * was able to drive dephosphorylation of GENE1 in checkpoint-arrested cells ( Fig. 7 C ) .

A constitutively active form of GENE1 ( referred to as GENE1 * ) can be created by mutating an autoinhibitory phosphorylation site ( Watanabe et al. , 1994 ) . Expression of GENE1 * from the GAL1 promoter caused rapid dephosphorylation of GENE2 ( Fig. 7 A ) . GENE1 * did not cause dephosphorylation of GENE2 in cells carrying a temperature-sensitive allele of OTHER_GENE ( cdc55 - 4 ) , which demonstrated that it acts via OTHER_GENE ( Fig. 7 B ) . GENE1 * was able to drive dephosphorylation of GENE2 in checkpoint-arrested cells ( Fig. 7 C ) .

To test for a role for Rho1 under conditions in which cell growth was not a complicating factor , we assayed the effects of a constitutively active form of Rho1 that was created by mutating glutamine 68 to histidine ( referred to as Rho1 * ; Delley and Hall , 1999 ) . Expression of OTHER_GENE * from the GAL1 promoter caused dephosphorylation of GENE1 in rapidly growing cells and in checkpoint-arrested cells ( Fig. 8 , D and E ) . Expression of OTHER_GENE * failed to induce GENE1 dephosphorylation in cells carrying a temperature-sensitive allele of GENE2 ( pkc1 - 21 ; Fig. 8 D ) . Together , these data establish that Rho1 signals to GENE1 via Pkc1 .

Next , to determine whether GENE1 inactivation causes activation of autophagic cell death , we examined the microscopic structure of cells by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) in HDAC1-depleted Hep3B cells . As expected , approximately 40 - 45 % of the GENE1 siRNA-transfected cells developed autophagic vacuoles after 72 h of post-transfection ( Figure 5A ) . At higher magnifications , most vacuoles contained electron dense material and degraded organelles . In contrast , control siRNA ( si-Scr ) transfected-cells were merely vacuolated , and fewer cells containing vacuoles in cytoplasm were observed ( right two panels in Figure 5A ) . Microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 ( LC3 ) is a common marker for detecting autophagy . LC3 is post-translationally modified by removal of its C-terminus to produce LC3-I ( ~18 kDa ) , with phosphatidylethanolamine lipidation giving rise to LC3-II ( ~16 kDa ) . Enrichment of membrane-bound LC3-II in autophagosomes is a distinctive phenomenon of autophagic cell death and the amount of LC3-II correlates well with the number of autophagosomes . In our experiments , GENE1 knockdown significantly increased the conversion of LC3B-I into LC3B-II as much as ceramide , a potent autophgy inducer , did in Hep3B cells ( Figure 5B ) . In contrast , treatment with 3-methyladenine ( 3-MA ; a specific inhibitor of autophagy ) prevented LC3B-I to LC3B-II conversion by GENE1 inactivation in Hep3B cells ( lane 5 in Figure 5B ) . In addition , immunofluorescence staining for GENE2 revealed that GENE1 inactivation induced ring-shaped spots evenly distributed throughout cytoplasm , indicating an association between LC3 and autophagosomal membranes , and this association was significantly blocked by 3-MA treatment ( Figure 5C ) . Consistent with this result , reduced cell viability caused by GENE1 inactivation was effectively blocked by 3-MA treatment ( Figure 5D ) . These results suggest that the GENE1 knockdown activates autophagic cell death in HCC cells . Interestingly , we also found that GENE1 inactivation did not affect Beclin-1 which participates during the early stages of autophagy , and that it promotes the nucleation of autophagic vesicles , and the recruitment of proteins from cytosol [ 26 ] . This implicated that GENE1 inactivation induced Beclin-1 independent autophay in Hep3B cells . To verify that GENE1 inactivation mediates LC3B-dependent autophagic cell death , GENE2 was silenced in Hep3B cells . As shown in Figure 5E , LC3B-II conversion induced by GENE1 inactivation was completely blocked by GENE2 knockdown in Hep3B cells . Further , the decreased cell viability by GENE1 inactivation was significantly restored by the co-transfection of GENE2 siRNA in Hep3B cells ( Figure 5F ) . Collectively , these results suggest that GENE1 inactivation contributes caspase-independent cell death through LC3-dependent autophagy in Hep3B cells .
( A ) Hep3B cells were transfected with GENE1 siRNA ( 100 nmol/L ) for 72 h , fixed and reviewed under the transmission electron microscope ( TEM ) ( left two panels ) . With a higher magnification , autophagosomes containing electron dense material and degraded organelles were observed in HDAC1-deficient cells . In contrast , a lot of intact mitochondria were observed in Hep3B cells transfected by si-Scr ( right two panels ) . Arrows indicate the presence of autophagosomes . ( B ) After knockdown of GENE1 , LC3 conversion ( LC3B-I to LC3B-II ) was markedly increased , whereas the level of Beclin 1 did not change . Parallel treatment with 5 mM 3-MA for 48 h inhibited LC3B-II activation induced by GENE1 knockdown . Hep3B cells were also treated with 25 microM ceramide for 24 h as a positive control for the autophagy . The densitometry result of the immunoblots was shown as a bar graph ( mean + - SD ) . Relative protein expressions of GENE1 , LC3B-II and Beclin 1 were normalized with the expression level of control ( si-Scr ) ( * p<0.05 ) . ( C ) In the immunofluorescence analysis , the cytosolic expression of GENE2 was induced by GENE1 knockdown , and which was reversed by the treatment with 3-MA in Hep3B cells . ( D ) MTT analysis shows that cell viability was regressed by GENE1 knockdown in Hep3B cell . The number of viable cells was increased in the parallel treatment of 3-MA for 48 h ( * p<0.05 ) . ( E ) Co-transfection of siRNA targeting GENE2 and/or GENE1 . The GENE2 conversion was induced by si-HDAC1 in the absence of si-LC3B . The level of proteins were quantified by ImageJ and normalized to GAPDH . Bar graph shows the relative ratio to si-Con transfectant ( * p<0.05 ) . ( F ) MTT analysis shows that the cells viability was recovered apparently in the presence of si-LC3B in GENE1 knockdown Hep3B cells ( * p<0.05 , si-HDAC1+si-LC3B vs si-HDAC1 ) .
Several proteins , including Iqg1 ( the sole IQGAP in budding yeast ) , Inn1 , Hof1 ( a F-BAR protein ) , and GENE1 have been implicated in PS formation ( Korinek et al. , 2000 ; Vallen et al. , 2000 ; Nishihama et al. , 2009 ; Meitinger et al. , 2010 ) , but the underlying mechanism remains unknown . Iqg1 is also required for actin ring assembly ( Epp and Chant , 1997 ; Lippincott and Li , 1998 ) . Of interest , overexpression of GENE1 suppresses the lethality and cytokinesis defects of iqg1 cells without restoring actin ring assembly , suggesting that GENE1 functions in an AMR-independent process : most likely septum formation : to promote cytokinesis ( Korinek et al. , 2000 ) . Overexpression of GENE1 also suppresses the cytokinesis and PS defects of inn1 cells ( Nishihama et al. , 2009 ) and causes the formation of ectopic PS-like structures in wild-type cells ( Meitinger et al. , 2010 ) . These observations suggest that GENE1 may be an activator of Chs2 . In this study , we show that overexpression of GENE1 robustly suppresses the growth and cytokinesis defects of the GENE2 phosphomutants , further supporting the " activator " hypothesis . We also demonstrate that GENE1 and Dbf2 phosphorylation define distinct mechanisms in regulating Chs2 function during cytokinesis .
GENE1 is a robust dosage suppressor of GENE2 phosphomutants
Cyk3 , a cytokinesis protein that localizes to the division site in a Dbf2-dependent manner ( Meitinger et al. , 2010 ) , has been implicated in PS formation , but the underlying mechanism remains unknown ( Korinek et al. , 2000 ; Nishihama et al. , 2009 ; Meitinger et al. , 2010 ) . It is striking that high-copy GENE1 robustly suppressed the growth and cytokinesis defects of both chs2-AA and chs2-DD cells ( Figure 7 , A and B ) . In contrast , high-copy GENE1 failed to rescue GENE2 cells ( Figure 7B ) , suggesting that the suppression is Chs2 dependent . Of importance , high-copy GENE1 strongly stimulated chitin synthesis at the division site of chs1Delta chs3Delta cells in which Chs2 is the sole chitin synthase ( Figure 7C ) . Reciprocally , deletion of GENE1 exacerbated the defects of the chs2-AA and chs2-DD mutants even when the mutant cells were grown in minimal media ( Figure 7D ) . Consistent with the notion of Cyk3 acting through Chs2 , cyk3 and GENE2 did not produce any additive or synergistic defect in growth or cytokinesis ( Figure 7D ) . Together these data strongly suggest that Cyk3 is an activator of Chs2 in vivo and that Cyk3 and Ser-217 phosphorylation regulate Chs2 function independently during cytokinesis .

Chl1 ( and the human homolog hChlR1 ) is a DNA helicase that promotes sister chromatid cohesion , and hChlR1 stimulates the flap endonuclease activity of hFen1.23 - 26 Prior evidence that ctf7/eco1 interacts genetically with chl1,24 coupled with the synthetic lethal ctf7/eco1 and GENE1 interaction described above , predicts that GENE1 might also interact genetically with GENE2 . To test this , chl1::HIS3 cells were crossed to fen1::KANr cells and the resulting diploids sporulated . High efficiency sporulation was observed . Tetrad analyses recovered the expected number of wild-type and both GENE2 and GENE1 single mutant strains ( Table 2 ) . In contrast , no GENE2 GENE1 double mutant spores were recovered ( Table 2 ) . This synthetic lethality extends findings obtained from a high-throughput assay that suggested that GENE2 and GENE1 interact genetically.29,30 The interrelated synthetic lethal network ( ctf7/eco1-fen1 ; fen1-chl1 ; chl1-ctf7/eco1-current study and Skibbens),24 supports the model that cohesion establishment is temporally coupled to lagging strand processing .

We next attempted to identify the specific FBP that targets GENE1 for degradation . GENE1 levels were compared among strains carrying single deletions of every non-essential yeast F-box protein ( Figure 2A ; data not shown ) , however no single deletion caused a significant increase in GENE1 protein levels . Furthermore , inactivation of the essential FBP GENE2 did not stabilize GENE1 ( Figure 2B ; Figure S1D ) . Together , these data suggested that GENE1 might be redundantly targeted by two or more FBPs . The most likely candidate FBPs to redundantly regulate GENE1 were OTHER_GENE and GENE2 , since each of these proteins is known to target Cdk-phosphorylated substrates [9]-[11 ] , [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] . Indeed , we found that simultaneous inactivation of OTHER_GENE and GENE2 led to complete stabilization of GENE1 , whereas deletion of OTHER_GENE or inactivation of GENE2 alone had no significant effect on GENE1 levels or stability ( Figure 2B ) . GENE1 protein was almost undetectable in both single mutant strains after only 2 minutes of cycloheximide treatment ( Figure 2C ) , and reintroduction of either GENE2 or OTHER_GENE into OTHER_GENE OTHER_GENE - 1 cells led to an equivalent reduction of GENE1 levels ( Figure S2A ) . Consistent with these observations , overexpression of GENE1 in either OTHER_GENE cells , or cells with limiting amounts of GENE2 ( OTHER_GENE - 1 grown at the permissive temperature ) was lethal ( Figure 2D ) , indicating that both FBPs are required for the cell to tolerate high levels of GENE1 . Together , these data demonstrate that GENE1 is redundantly regulated by GENE2 and OTHER_GENE .

OTHER_GENE levels were compared among strains carrying single deletions of every non-essential yeast F-box protein ( Figure 2A ; data not shown ) , however no single deletion caused a significant increase in OTHER_GENE protein levels . Furthermore , inactivation of the essential FBP OTHER_GENE did not stabilize OTHER_GENE ( Figure 2B ; Figure S1D ) . Together , these data suggested that OTHER_GENE might be redundantly targeted by two or more FBPs . The most likely candidate FBPs to redundantly regulate OTHER_GENE were GENE1 and OTHER_GENE , since each of these proteins is known to target Cdk-phosphorylated substrates [9]-[11 ] , [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] . Indeed , we found that simultaneous inactivation of GENE1 and OTHER_GENE led to complete stabilization of OTHER_GENE , whereas deletion of GENE2 or inactivation of OTHER_GENE alone had no significant effect on OTHER_GENE levels or stability ( Figure 2B ) . OTHER_GENE protein was almost undetectable in both single mutant strains after only 2 minutes of cycloheximide treatment ( Figure 2C ) , and reintroduction of either OTHER_GENE or GENE1 into OTHER_GENE OTHER_GENE - 1 cells led to an equivalent reduction of OTHER_GENE levels ( Figure S2A ) . Consistent with these observations , overexpression of OTHER_GENE in either OTHER_GENE cells , or cells with limiting amounts of OTHER_GENE ( OTHER_GENE - 1 grown at the permissive temperature ) was lethal ( Figure 2D ) , indicating that both FBPs are required for the cell to tolerate high levels of OTHER_GENE . Together , these data demonstrate that OTHER_GENE is redundantly regulated by OTHER_GENE and GENE1 .

Genetic Interaction between GENE1 and GENE2
The finding that GENE1 and Grr1 can bind to some of the same Cdk-phosphorylated proteins , and that they redundantly target Cln3 for degradation in vivo , suggests that these two FBPs may share a number of overlapping targets that are important for cell cycle progression . In support of this possibility , we found that cells carrying a OTHER_GENE deletion and having compromised GENE1 function ( GENE2 OTHER_GENE - 1 , grown at the permissive temperature for OTHER_GENE - 1 ) demonstrate a synergistic growth defect well beyond that predicted for a combination of the individual ( minor ) growth phenotypes ( Figure 7 ) . This type of negative genetic interaction is consistent with GENE1 and Grr1 having partially redundant roles in one or more common cellular functions [ 40 ] . Importantly , deletion of CLN3 did not reverse this growth defect ( Figure 7 ) , supporting the idea that additional proteins are redundantly targeted by GENE1 and Grr1 . Alternatively , it is possible that GENE1 and Grr1 have specific substrates that cause a synergistic growth defect when their levels are elevated . However , the large number of unstable , Cdk-phosphorylated proteins in the cell [ 13 ] , [ 14 ] , [ 41 ] , combined with the ability of Grr1 and GENE1 to bind some targets in common , raises the intriguing possibility that these two FBPs target a significant fraction of the cell cycle proteome for degradation .

GENE1 turnover is essential for accurate entry into the cell cycle and for proper cell size control [24]-[26 ] , however the identity of the ubiquitin ligase that targets GENE1 for destruction has remained a long-standing question . Here , we show that GENE1 is redundantly targeted by two F-box proteins with key cell cycle-regulatory roles , GENE2 and OTHER_GENE . Interestingly , inactivation of either FBP alone has no detectable effect on GENE1 expression or half-life , yet GENE1 is completely stable in double mutant cells ( Figure 2B-2C ) . This result is quite surprising because , although redundant regulation of degradation has been previously found for other proteasome substrates in both yeast and mammals [42]-[44 ] , in most cases elimination of one ubiquitin ligase or the other leads to a partial stabilization of the substrate , which we do not observe with GENE1 . This may be because targeting of these other substrates by two ligases is only partially redundant in the sense that the ligases may recognize different epitopes on the substrate , or respond to different physiological cues .

To resolve the discrepancy between the YPD and SC media , we conducted quantitative chitin assays to determine the extent to which chitin was restored to the cell walls of these strains . To conduct these assays , we lysed cells in an alkaline solution from which cell wall material was recovered in an insoluble fraction . This material was digested with chitinases to yield N-acetyl-glucosamine ( GlcNAc ) , which was quantified using a colorimetric assay . As expected , a OTHER_GENE mutant , where Chs3p is not targeted to the PM , had low levels of chitin in the cell wall , compared to wt ( Figure 3B ) . The OTHER_GENE AP-2Delta strain had low levels of chitin equivalent to the parental OTHER_GENE strain , confirming that AP-2 does not play a significant role in trafficking Chs3p . Conversely , the OTHER_GENE GENE1 strain had a level of chitin that was much greater than that of the OTHER_GENE single mutant , and interestingly , the OTHER_GENE GENE2 strain contained a level of chitin that was intermediate between that of the OTHER_GENE single mutant and the OTHER_GENE GENE1 mutant . This result indicated that AP-3 is important for the intracellular transport of Chs3p , but plays a less significant role than AP-1 . The lower level of chitin in OTHER_GENE GENE2 cells may explain why this strain did not show obvious calcofluor sensitivity on YPD . Our general experience with chitin assays is that growth in SC medium leads to higher levels of chitin in the cell wall compared to growth in YPD . The reason for this difference is unknown , but may explain why the OTHER_GENE GENE2 strain showed partial calcofluor sensitivity on SC medium but not YPD .

OTHER_GENE is an evolutionarily conserved DNA repair scaffolding protein important for the cellular response to exogenous DNA damaging agents4,5,6,7 , and mutations in human SLX4 were recently linked to Fanconi anemia8,9 . In budding yeast , slx4Delta cells are highly sensitive to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS)7 , a DNA alkylating agent that induces replication blocks and DDC activation . While investigating the activation status of the budding yeast DDC kinase GENE1 in slx4Delta cells , we noticed that MMS treatment leads to hyperphosphorylation , thus hyperactivation , of GENE1 when compared to wild-type cells ( Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. 1a ) , consistent with a previous report10 . Phosphorylation of histone H2a ( Hta1/Hta2 ) , a substrate of the upstream DDC kinase Mec1 , at serine 129 ( here referred as H2apS129 ) was not increased in slx4Delta cells , however ( Fig. 1a , lower panel ) . These results suggest that the hyperactivation of GENE1 in slx4Delta cells is not caused by increased damage-induced Mec1 signaling but results from improper downstream regulation of GENE1 activation . To test this possibility , we compared the phosphoproteome of wild-type and slx4Delta cells following MMS treatment using quantitative mass-spectrometry . While most of the detected Mec1 targets are phosphorylated to the same extent in both cell types , Rad53-dependent phosphorylation is significantly increased in slx4Delta cells ( Supplementary Fig. 1b ) , further supporting that OTHER_GENE plays a role in specifically blocking GENE1 hyperactivation . Because activation of GENE1 in response to MMS is mostly dependent on the checkpoint adaptor GENE2 ( Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 2 ) , OTHER_GENE likely counteracts Rad9-dependent GENE1 activation .

To test whether the sensitivity of GENE1 cells to MMS is caused mostly by aberrant GENE2 hyperactivation , we used hypomorphic alleles of rad53 that reduce GENE2 activation , reasoning that they would rescue the MMS sensitivity of GENE1 cells . GENE2 has two FHA domains that redundantly bind to phosphorylated Rad9 to mediate GENE2 activation11 ( Fig. 1c ) , and mutations in the FHA2 domain promote a stronger reduction in MMS-induced GENE2 activation than mutations in the FHA1 domain12 . Whereas a mutation ( R70A ) in the FHA1 domain of GENE2 had no effect on the MMS sensitivity of GENE1 cells , a mutation ( R605A ) in the FHA2 domain reduced the sensitivity of GENE1 cells ( Fig. 1d ) . Consistent with our hypothesis that GENE2 hyperactivation is the cause of the MMS sensitivity of GENE1 cells , mutation of the FHA2 domain reduced GENE2 activation in GENE1 cells to a level similar to wild-type ( Fig. 1e ) . Collectively , these results suggest that Slx4 has a crucial role in preventing excessive Rad9-dependent activation of GENE2 ( Fig. 1f ) . Because the levels of MMS used here require that cells pass through S phase for GENE2 to become active13 , our results suggest that Slx4 counteracts the Rad9-Rad53 pathway in response to replication-induced lesions . The fact that combined deletion of the SLX1 and RAD1 genes , which encode nucleases known to associate with Slx4 , leads to lower MMS sensitivity and GENE2 activation compared to GENE1 cells ( Supplementary Fig. 4 ) supports a nuclease-independent function for Slx4 during the cellular response to MMS-induced replication stress .
Slx4 forms a tight complex with the BRCT domain-containing protein Rtt107 , a DNA repair scaffold that stabilizes the Dpb11-Slx4 interaction14 . Analysis of the phospho-status of OTHER_GENE in OTHER_GENE cells revealed that DDC signaling is hyperactivated ( Fig. 3a ) , suggesting that Rtt107 contributes to a similar function as Slx4 in counteracting OTHER_GENE activation . Rtt107 recognizes H2apS129 via its C-terminal pair of BRCT domains ( BRCT5/6 ) and this region is essential for Rtt107 's role in the MMS response ( Supplementary Figs 9 and 10)22 . Furthermore , mutation of serine 129 to alanine ( h2a-S129A ) abrogated the phosphorylation of Slx4 upon MMS treatment ( Fig. 3b ) , suggesting that the recruitment of Rtt107 to H2apS129 occurs upstream of Slx4-Dpb11 complex formation . Because H2apS129 can function as a positive regulator of Rad9-dependent OTHER_GENE activation23 , we reasoned that the hyperactivation of OTHER_GENE in OTHER_GENE cells could be suppressed by h2a-S129A . OTHER_GENE cells expressing the GENE1 mutant exhibit reduced OTHER_GENE activation and MMS sensitivity than OTHER_GENE cells expressing wild-type OTHER_GENE ( Fig. 3c , d ) . Disruption of the Rad9-H2a interaction by mutation of the C-terminal pair of BRCT domains of GENE2 ( K1088 M ) partially rescues MMS-sensitivity of OTHER_GENE cells ( Supplementary Fig. 11a ) . A similar rescue is also observed when overexpressing BRCT5/6 of Rtt107 ( Supplementary Fig. 11b ) . Taken together , these results reveal that Rtt107 also counteracts DDC signaling . The anti-checkpoint function of Rtt107 depends on its recognition of H2apS129 , a step that is further required for the assembly of the Slx4-Dpb11 complex . Thus , the Slx4-Rtt107 complex functions as a negative regulator of OTHER_GENE kinase activation by physically interacting with two positive regulators of the GENE2 adaptor , Dpb11 and H2apS129 .

To better understand the role of the SUN domain in mitotic processes , we introduced mps3-F592S , mps3-Y502H , and mps3-A540D mutants into a query strain for synthetic genetic array analysis ( SGA ) . Because some of these alleles result in spontaneous diploidization , the query strain contained a wild-type copy of MPS3 on a URA3-marked plasmid ( Figure 2A ) . We reconfirmed that these mutations confer a ts growth phenotype and exhibit the same changes in ploidy and mitotic arrest when the covering plasmid is removed using 5-FOA in the SGA strain background ( Figure 1A ) . Each mutant was then mated to the collection of nonessential yeast deletions , the covering plasmid was removed after diploid selection , and sporulation was induced by growth on media lacking nitrogen . Following two rounds of haploid selection , growth of viable MATa haploids was compared at the permissive temperature of 23 on media containing G418 , which selects for the deletion mutant , and media containing G418 and clonNAT , which selects for both the deletion mutant and the GENE1 SUN domain mutant allele ( Figure 2B ) . Each screen was repeated at least three times , and a list of ~400 gene deletions that resulted in decreased growth when combined with one or more GENE1 mutant was generated by visual inspection of plates . These 400 deletion mutants were put into a mini-array and were rescreened with each GENE1 allele two to three times , resulting in potential hits that were then confirmed by random sporulation and/or tetrad dissection . Examples of the random sporulation plates from two hits are show in Figure 2C . We performed a separate SGA screen with GENE2 - 150 . In total , 106 interactions were identified . Genes that we identified as inviable ( synthetic lethality ; SL ) or slow growing ( synthetically sick ; SS or weakly synthetically sick ; WSS ) when combined with mps3-Y502H , mps3-A540D , mps3-F592S , or GENE2 - 150 are listed in Table S1 .
Does this mean that mutation of the OTHER_GENE SUN domain does not affect nuclear organization ? Given the small number of hits observed in our mps3Delta75 - 150 screen , the overlap between it and the SUN mutants may have been missed . Based on the fact that all three SUN mutants interact with genes involved in chromatin structure or modification ( OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE ) , DNA replication , repair or recombination ( OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , GENE1 ) , and transcription/translation ( OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , GENE2 , OTHER_GENE ) suggests that changes in genes affecting nuclear processes exacerbates the growth defect associated with a mutation in the OTHER_GENE SUN domain ( Figure 3B , Table S1 ) . This extensive set of genetic interactions lends considerable evidence to the idea that the mps3 SUN mutants are at least partially defective in aspects of nuclear structure or function . However , because these interacting genes do not fall into a single obvious class of chromatin modifying enzymes or transcriptional activators/repressors , it is difficult to determine exactly what nuclear processes are affected in the absence of OTHER_GENE SUN domain function . It also is possible that the effects of at least some of these deletions are indirect .

Given the small number of hits observed in our mps3Delta75 - 150 screen , the overlap between it and the SUN mutants may have been missed . Based on the fact that all three SUN mutants interact with genes involved in chromatin structure or modification ( OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , GENE1 , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE ) , DNA replication , repair or recombination ( OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE ) , and transcription/translation ( OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , GENE2 , OTHER_GENE ) suggests that changes in genes affecting nuclear processes exacerbates the growth defect associated with a mutation in the OTHER_GENE SUN domain ( Figure 3B , Table S1 ) . This extensive set of genetic interactions lends considerable evidence to the idea that the mps3 SUN mutants are at least partially defective in aspects of nuclear structure or function . However , because these interacting genes do not fall into a single obvious class of chromatin modifying enzymes or transcriptional activators/repressors , it is difficult to determine exactly what nuclear processes are affected in the absence of OTHER_GENE SUN domain function . It also is possible that the effects of at least some of these deletions are indirect .

Given the small number of hits observed in our mps3Delta75 - 150 screen , the overlap between it and the SUN mutants may have been missed . Based on the fact that all three SUN mutants interact with genes involved in chromatin structure or modification ( OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , GENE1 ) , DNA replication , repair or recombination ( OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE ) , and transcription/translation ( OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , GENE2 , OTHER_GENE ) suggests that changes in genes affecting nuclear processes exacerbates the growth defect associated with a mutation in the OTHER_GENE SUN domain ( Figure 3B , Table S1 ) . This extensive set of genetic interactions lends considerable evidence to the idea that the mps3 SUN mutants are at least partially defective in aspects of nuclear structure or function . However , because these interacting genes do not fall into a single obvious class of chromatin modifying enzymes or transcriptional activators/repressors , it is difficult to determine exactly what nuclear processes are affected in the absence of OTHER_GENE SUN domain function . It also is possible that the effects of at least some of these deletions are indirect .

Given the small number of hits observed in our mps3Delta75 - 150 screen , the overlap between it and the SUN mutants may have been missed . Based on the fact that all three SUN mutants interact with genes involved in chromatin structure or modification ( OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE ) , DNA replication , repair or recombination ( GENE2 , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE ) , and transcription/translation ( OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE ) suggests that changes in genes affecting nuclear processes exacerbates the growth defect associated with a mutation in the GENE1 SUN domain ( Figure 3B , Table S1 ) . This extensive set of genetic interactions lends considerable evidence to the idea that the mps3 SUN mutants are at least partially defective in aspects of nuclear structure or function .

Based on the fact that all three SUN mutants interact with genes involved in chromatin structure or modification ( OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , GENE1 , OTHER_GENE ) , DNA replication , repair or recombination ( OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE ) , and transcription/translation ( OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , GENE2 , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE ) suggests that changes in genes affecting nuclear processes exacerbates the growth defect associated with a mutation in the OTHER_GENE SUN domain ( Figure 3B , Table S1 ) . This extensive set of genetic interactions lends considerable evidence to the idea that the mps3 SUN mutants are at least partially defective in aspects of nuclear structure or function . However , because these interacting genes do not fall into a single obvious class of chromatin modifying enzymes or transcriptional activators/repressors , it is difficult to determine exactly what nuclear processes are affected in the absence of OTHER_GENE SUN domain function . It also is possible that the effects of at least some of these deletions are indirect .

Based on the fact that all three SUN mutants interact with genes involved in chromatin structure or modification ( OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , GENE1 , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE ) , DNA replication , repair or recombination ( OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE ) , and transcription/translation ( GENE2 , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE ) suggests that changes in genes affecting nuclear processes exacerbates the growth defect associated with a mutation in the OTHER_GENE SUN domain ( Figure 3B , Table S1 ) . This extensive set of genetic interactions lends considerable evidence to the idea that the mps3 SUN mutants are at least partially defective in aspects of nuclear structure or function . However , because these interacting genes do not fall into a single obvious class of chromatin modifying enzymes or transcriptional activators/repressors , it is difficult to determine exactly what nuclear processes are affected in the absence of OTHER_GENE SUN domain function . It also is possible that the effects of at least some of these deletions are indirect .

Based on the fact that all three SUN mutants interact with genes involved in chromatin structure or modification ( OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , GENE1 , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE ) , DNA replication , repair or recombination ( OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE ) , and transcription/translation ( OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , GENE2 ) suggests that changes in genes affecting nuclear processes exacerbates the growth defect associated with a mutation in the OTHER_GENE SUN domain ( Figure 3B , Table S1 ) . This extensive set of genetic interactions lends considerable evidence to the idea that the mps3 SUN mutants are at least partially defective in aspects of nuclear structure or function . However , because these interacting genes do not fall into a single obvious class of chromatin modifying enzymes or transcriptional activators/repressors , it is difficult to determine exactly what nuclear processes are affected in the absence of OTHER_GENE SUN domain function . It also is possible that the effects of at least some of these deletions are indirect .

All three SUN domain mutants also displayed growth defects when combined with deletions in genes encoding the spindle checkpoint proteins GENE1 , OTHER_GENE , or OTHER_GENE , and mps3-Y502H and mps3-F592S are synthetically sick when combined with OTHER_GENE and mps3-F592S is synthetically sick together with OTHER_GENE [ Figure 3 , A and B , Table S1 ( Winey and Bloom 2012 ) ] . Genetic interactions between mps3Delta75 - 150 and each of the spindle checkpoint genes were not identified , and direct testing showed that mps3Delta75 - 150 is not SL or SS with mutants in any of these checkpoint factors ( data not shown ) . These findings are consistent with the idea that the SUN domain , but not the N-terminal acidic domain , is important for Mps3 's function at the SPB ( Bupp et al. 2007 ; Jaspersen et al. 2006 ) . Somewhat surprisingly , only a few other genes that encode proteins affecting microtubule function or mitotic chromosome segregation were identified as SL or SS with GENE2 alleles ( Figure 3 , A and B , Table S1 ) . One possible explanation for this phenomenon could be that many genes involved in mitotic spindle assembly , such as those encoding 17 of 18 SPB components , most kinetochore proteins and alpha- , beta- , and gamma-tubulin ( TUB1 , TUB2 , and TUB4 , respectively ) are essential and are not present in the nonessential yeast deletion collection ( Jaspersen and Winey 2004 ; Winey and Bloom 2012 ; Winzeler et al. 1999 ) .

In addition to genes that affect spindle function or nuclear organization , our OTHER_GENE SUN SGA screens also were enriched in genes affecting additional biological processes that may shed light into novel functions of SUN proteins during cell division . We found that a number of genes implicated in mitochondrial function ( OTHER_GENE , GENE1 , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , GENE2 ) , lipid biosynthesis ( OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE ) , and other aspects of organelle biogenesis and transport ( OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE ; Figure 3B , Table S1 ) displayed genetic interactions with all three OTHER_GENE SUN domain mutants . Three poorly characterized ORFs suspected to play a role in ER function based on genetic interactions in high-throughput screens also were identified in our screens ( Jonikas et al. 2009 ) . These factors ( LCL2 , SLP1 , EMP65/YER140W ) are ideal candidates to participate in folding or targeting of Mps3 or in other functions needed for SPB duplication because integral membrane proteins needed for SPB assembly must be first inserted into the ER and then transported to the NE ( Burns and Wente 2012 ; Jaspersen and Ghosh 2012 ) . Because OTHER_GENE and OTHER_GENE were SS or SL with all three OTHER_GENE SUN domain mutants ( Figure 2C , Figure 3 , Table S1 ) , we focused on further characterizing the function of Emp65 and Slp1 .

We found that a number of genes implicated in mitochondrial function ( OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE ) , lipid biosynthesis ( OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , GENE1 , OTHER_GENE ) , and other aspects of organelle biogenesis and transport ( OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , GENE2 ; Figure 3B , Table S1 ) displayed genetic interactions with all three OTHER_GENE SUN domain mutants . Three poorly characterized ORFs suspected to play a role in ER function based on genetic interactions in high-throughput screens also were identified in our screens ( Jonikas et al. 2009 ) . These factors ( LCL2 , SLP1 , EMP65/YER140W ) are ideal candidates to participate in folding or targeting of Mps3 or in other functions needed for SPB duplication because integral membrane proteins needed for SPB assembly must be first inserted into the ER and then transported to the NE ( Burns and Wente 2012 ; Jaspersen and Ghosh 2012 ) .

We found that a number of genes implicated in mitochondrial function ( OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE ) , lipid biosynthesis ( OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE ) , and other aspects of organelle biogenesis and transport ( OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , GENE1 , OTHER_GENE ; Figure 3B , Table S1 ) displayed genetic interactions with all three OTHER_GENE SUN domain mutants . Three poorly characterized ORFs suspected to play a role in ER function based on genetic interactions in high-throughput screens also were identified in our screens ( Jonikas et al. 2009 ) . These factors ( LCL2 , SLP1 , EMP65/YER140W ) are ideal candidates to participate in folding or targeting of Mps3 or in other functions needed for SPB duplication because integral membrane proteins needed for SPB assembly must be first inserted into the ER and then transported to the NE ( Burns and Wente 2012 ; Jaspersen and Ghosh 2012 ) .

We found that a number of genes implicated in mitochondrial function ( OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE ) , lipid biosynthesis ( GENE1 , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , GENE2 , OTHER_GENE ) , and other aspects of organelle biogenesis and transport ( OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE ; Figure 3B , Table S1 ) displayed genetic interactions with all three OTHER_GENE SUN domain mutants . Three poorly characterized ORFs suspected to play a role in ER function based on genetic interactions in high-throughput screens also were identified in our screens ( Jonikas et al. 2009 ) . These factors ( LCL2 , SLP1 , EMP65/YER140W ) are ideal candidates to participate in folding or targeting of Mps3 or in other functions needed for SPB duplication because integral membrane proteins needed for SPB assembly must be first inserted into the ER and then transported to the NE ( Burns and Wente 2012 ; Jaspersen and Ghosh 2012 ) .

We found that a number of genes implicated in mitochondrial function ( OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE ) , lipid biosynthesis ( OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , GENE1 , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE ) , and other aspects of organelle biogenesis and transport ( OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , GENE2 ; Figure 3B , Table S1 ) displayed genetic interactions with all three OTHER_GENE SUN domain mutants . Three poorly characterized ORFs suspected to play a role in ER function based on genetic interactions in high-throughput screens also were identified in our screens ( Jonikas et al. 2009 ) . These factors ( LCL2 , SLP1 , EMP65/YER140W ) are ideal candidates to participate in folding or targeting of Mps3 or in other functions needed for SPB duplication because integral membrane proteins needed for SPB assembly must be first inserted into the ER and then transported to the NE ( Burns and Wente 2012 ; Jaspersen and Ghosh 2012 ) .

We found that a number of genes implicated in mitochondrial function ( OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , GENE1 , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE ) , lipid biosynthesis ( OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , GENE2 , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE ) , and other aspects of organelle biogenesis and transport ( OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE ; Figure 3B , Table S1 ) displayed genetic interactions with all three OTHER_GENE SUN domain mutants . Three poorly characterized ORFs suspected to play a role in ER function based on genetic interactions in high-throughput screens also were identified in our screens ( Jonikas et al. 2009 ) . These factors ( LCL2 , SLP1 , EMP65/YER140W ) are ideal candidates to participate in folding or targeting of Mps3 or in other functions needed for SPB duplication because integral membrane proteins needed for SPB assembly must be first inserted into the ER and then transported to the NE ( Burns and Wente 2012 ; Jaspersen and Ghosh 2012 ) . Because OTHER_GENE and OTHER_GENE were SS or SL with all three OTHER_GENE SUN domain mutants ( Figure 2C , Figure 3 , Table S1 ) , we focused on further characterizing the function of Emp65 and Slp1 .
The two most striking interactors were GENE1 and OTHER_GENE , both of which strongly inhibited growth of all three GENE2 SUN domain mutants . As suggested by both our genetic interactions and those of Jonikas et al. , Slp1 and Emp65 form a membrane-associated protein complex ( Jonikas et al. 2009 ) . Two high throughput proteomics analyses suggested that Emp65 , but not Slp1 , was associated with mitochondria ( Reinders et al. 2006 ; Sickmann et al. 2003 ) . However , we were unable to observe significant colocalization of GFP-Emp65 with mitotracker red , a dye that allows visualization of mitochondria ( data not shown ) . Rather , our data suggest that Slp1-Emp65 are present on both cortical and perinuclear ER membranes where they form a membrane-associated complex .

To ascertain whether these general observations might extend to newly described essential CIN cancer genes , we carried out SGA analysis on OTHER_GENE - 1 . The essential gene TAF1 encodes the largest subunit of TFIID , and the OTHER_GENE - 1 mutation causes increased CIN ( Stirling et al. 2011 ) . The human genome encodes two closely related TAF1 orthologs , TAF1 and TAF1L , which together are mutated in > 10 % of colon adenocarcinoma and > 20 % of lung squamous cell carcinoma [ TCGA data via MSKCC www.cbioportal.org/public_portal ( The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network 2012 ) ] . Although the significance of the TAF1/1L mutations is not known , the frequency of mutations suggest that TAF1/1L may play some functional role in modulating the phenotype of cancer cells . Regardless , the mutations in TAF1/1L might represent an Achilles ' heel for SL targeting of a CIN gene mutated in many tumors . SGA analysis of OTHER_GENE - 1 revealed that , in addition to the expected interactions with transcription initiation and chromatin remodeling ( e.g. , TFIID , mediator , SWR-c ) , OTHER_GENE - 1 also exhibited negative genetic interactions with spindle checkpoint ( GENE1 ) , DNA replication and P-body genes ( GENE2 ; Figure S1 ) . This pattern is broadly similar to that seen for many other , unrelated CIN cancer genes in Figure 2B . Overall , our network analysis , supported by the example of TAF1 , suggests that common features underlie the genetic interaction spectrum of mutants with genome instability . Specific inhibition of genes functioning within these ' hub ' processes could therefore be broadly useful as therapy .

Other than TAF1 , the genetic networks described previously were generated using publicly-available data , which until recently has been comprised almost exclusively of screens with nonessential gene deletion mutations . The relative paucity of essential gene mutants in the published SL network thus represents an opportunity to identify new highly connected second-site candidate therapeutic targets . We sought to expand the known genetic interaction space for important cancer gene orthologs by direct screening for interactions with essential genes . We screened nine query mutations whose human orthologs are mutated in cancer ( GENE1 , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , GENE2 , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , and OTHER_GENE - 42 ) against a miniarray of 1161 DAmP or ts-alleles in 923 essential yeast genes ( Breslow et al. 2008 ; Li et al. 2011 ) .

Other than TAF1 , the genetic networks described previously were generated using publicly-available data , which until recently has been comprised almost exclusively of screens with nonessential gene deletion mutations . The relative paucity of essential gene mutants in the published SL network thus represents an opportunity to identify new highly connected second-site candidate therapeutic targets .

In previous analyses authors also have recognized the importance of DNA replication fork proteins in genetic networks of cancer genes ( Yuen et al. 2007 ) . One of the most highly connected replication fork proteins is Ctf4 , which appears to function as a scaffold during DNA replication and repair , acting as a hub of protein-protein interactions ( I m et al. 2009 ; Mimura et al. 2010 ; Zhu et al. 2007 ) . To attempt to separate these functions of Ctf4 , we sequenced and characterized a set of nine CTF4 mutant alleles that are represented by four missense mutants and five nonsense mutants , isolated in the original CTF screen ( Figure S2 ) ( Spencer et al. 1990 ) . This analysis primarily revealed that the ability to bind its partner proteins is crucial for Ctf4 to perform its cellular genome integrity function ( Figure S2 , Table S6 , and File S1 ) . SGA analysis of GENE1 against an array of essential gene mutants confirmed the enrichment of cellular genome stability pathways , including those whose orthologs are recurrently mutated in tumors ( e.g. , cohesins , OTHER_GENE , GENE2 ; Figure S3 , Table S5 , Table S7 , and Table S8 ) .

OTHER_GENE physically interacts with the MCM complex , the repair factor Mms22 , the POLalpha primase complex , the GINS complex , and the replication-associated factors Cdc45 and Mcm10 ( I m et al. 2009 ; Mimura et al. 2010 ; Zhu et al. 2007 ) . Our approach predicts that mutants in these Ctf4-interacting proteins would mimic some of the genetic interactions of ctf4Delta with cancer-gene orthologs . Figure 4A summarizes the results of direct testing for negative genetic interactions between the cancer-gene orthologs OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , and GENE1 and mutant alleles of OTHER_GENE , GENE2 , primase , MCM , or GINS complexes . In almost every case , interactions are observed between each cancer-gene ortholog and at least one member of the Ctf4-interacting complexes . Because all of the Ctf4-interacting genes are essential , partial loss-of-function ( i.e. , DAmP or ts ) alleles are used , potentially explaining why not all genes tested show interactions . Regardless , the result strongly validates the approach of targeting pathways and functional partners of hub genes for SL killing of cancer cells when the original candidate target gene is not immediately amenable to small-molecule inhibitor development .

Our data predict that human cancer cells with certain CIN mutations should be sensitized to perturbation of the aforementioned replisome components . Thus , we attempted to recapitulate some of the genetic interactions in human cells by using siRNA-mediated knockdown of the human orthologs of selected members of the network shown in Figure 4A . We used the karyotypically stable , near-diploid colorectal cancer cell line HCT116 as a model system ( McLellan et al. 2012 ; McManus et al. 2009).We targeted GENE1 , MCM10 , GINS1/PSF1 , OTHER_GENE , and OTHER_GENE for knockdown by siRNA and asked whether these treatments sensitized cells to chemical inhibition of OTHER_GENE with mirin , a recently described inhibitor of Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex activity ( Dupre et al. 2008 ) . We found that knockdown of MCM10 did not sensitize cells to mirin treatment , whereas knockdown of the other four targets significantly reduced cell viability in the presence of mirin ( Figure 5A ) . We validated this chemical-genetic interaction by using dual siRNA-mediated knockdown , depleting cells of OTHER_GENE simultaneously with GENE1 , GENE2 , OTHER_GENE , or OTHER_GENE . We found that , 4 d after transfection , the number of cells remaining after dual knockdown treatments was less than the predicted product of that of the two single knockdowns , indicative of a synergistic effect of the two siRNAs ( Figure 5B ) . These genetic interactions were confirmed by a colony formation assay ( Figure 5C ) . Although we acknowledge that our results only reflect the genetic interaction network in a single cell line , taken together , these data support the concept of using biological network information to predict alternative therapeutic genetic interactions when a promising target ( i.e. , Ctf4 ) is not readily druggable .

These genetic interactions were confirmed by a colony formation assay ( Figure 5C ) . Although we acknowledge that our results only reflect the genetic interaction network in a single cell line , taken together , these data support the concept of using biological network information to predict alternative therapeutic genetic interactions when a promising target ( i.e. , Ctf4 ) is not readily druggable .
Our data predict that human cancer cells with certain CIN mutations should be sensitized to perturbation of the aforementioned replisome components . Thus , we attempted to recapitulate some of the genetic interactions in human cells by using siRNA-mediated knockdown of the human orthologs of selected members of the network shown in Figure 4A . We used the karyotypically stable , near-diploid colorectal cancer cell line HCT116 as a model system ( McLellan et al. 2012 ; McManus et al. 2009).We targeted OTHER_GENE , MCM10 , GINS1/PSF1 , GENE1 , and OTHER_GENE for knockdown by siRNA and asked whether these treatments sensitized cells to chemical inhibition of OTHER_GENE with mirin , a recently described inhibitor of Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 complex activity ( Dupre et al. 2008 ) . We found that knockdown of MCM10 did not sensitize cells to mirin treatment , whereas knockdown of the other four targets significantly reduced cell viability in the presence of mirin ( Figure 5A ) .

Suppression of the UV sensitivity of GENE1 mutants by different alleles of GENE2 . Haploid strains in a RAD18 ( filled circles , solid lines ) and GENE1 ( filled squares , dotted lines ) background were grown to stationary phase in liquid YEPD medium and exposed to UV irradiation at 0.5 J/m2/s as described in Supplementary data . Each point on the curves is the average of three experiments .
Overexpression of GENE1 is growth inhibitory to GENE2 truncation and deletion mutants . Strains with the indicated genetic backgrounds ( see Figure 3 ) and maintaining plasmid pGAL-DPH5 for galactose inducible overexpression of Dph5 were serially diluted and spotted onto glucose ( 2 % glc ) and galactose ( 2 % gal ) media to assay their response to GENE1 overexpression . Unaltered tolerance ( T ) and sensitive ( S ) responses are indicated .
In response to replication-blocking lesions , proliferating cell nuclear antigen ( OTHER_GENE ) can be sequentially ubiquitinated at the K164 residue , leading to two modes of DNA-damage tolerance , namely , translesion DNA synthesis ( TLS ) and error-free lesion bypass . Although the majority of reported data support a model whereby monoubiquitinated OTHER_GENE enhances its affinity for TLS polymerases and hence recruits them to the damage sites , this model has also been challenged by several observations . In this study , we expressed the PCNA-164R and ubiquitin ( UB ) fusion genes in an inducible manner in an attempt to mimic OTHER_GENE monoubiquitination in cultured human cells . It was found that expression of both N- and C-terminal OTHER_GENE Ub fusions conferred significant tolerance to ultraviolet (UV)-induced DNA damage . Surprisingly , depletion of Poleta , a TLS polymerase dedicated to bypassing UV-induced pyrimidine dimers , did not alter tolerance conferred by OTHER_GENE Ub . In contrast , depletion of GENE1 , another TLS polymerase serving as a scaffold for the assembly of the TLS complex , completely abolished OTHER_GENE Ub-mediated damage tolerance . Similar genetic interactions were confirmed when UV-induced monoubiquitination of endogenous OTHER_GENE is abolished by GENE2 deletion . Hence , OTHER_GENE Ub fusions bypass the requirement for OTHER_GENE monoubiquitination , and UV damage tolerance conferred by these fusions is dependent on GENE1 but independent of Poleta .

As OTHER_GENE is the crucially negative regulator of GENE1 activity identified hitherto and GENE2 is positive regulator of GENE1 activity . We want to know whether OTHER_GENE inhibits Axin-induced GENE1 activation . To address this question , we generated MDM2-expressing vector from the cDNA of HEK 293 cells and detected the E3 activity of wild type OTHER_GENE toward GENE1 . As shown in Figure S1 , wild type OTHER_GENE showed strong E3 activity toward GENE1 , in contrast , OTHER_GENE ( C464A ) , an E3 ligase-dead mutant of OTHER_GENE , completely lost E3 activity toward GENE1 . Then we investigated the regulatory effect of OTHER_GENE on Axin-stimulated GENE1 activation by using the PathDetect GENE1 cis-Reporting System ( Stratagene ) that carries the p53-specific enhancer elements [ 8 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] . As shown in Figure 1A , OTHER_GENE can strongly decrease luciferase activation induced by GENE2 . We then asked whether ubiquitin E3 ligase activity of OTHER_GENE is essential for its inhibitory effect on Axin-induced GENE1 transactivity and performed luciferase reporter assay by using E3 ligase-dead mutant , MDM2(C464A ) . Surprisingly , we found that MDM2(C464A ) exhibited the same inhibition on Axin-induced GENE1 transcriptional activity as did wild type OTHER_GENE ( Figure 1A ) . Consistently , MDM2DeltaRING , another E3 ligase-dead mutant of OTHER_GENE that is deleted for its RING domain retained the ability of OTHER_GENE on inhibition of GENE1 transactivity induced by GENE2 , indicating that E3 activity of OTHER_GENE is not required to inhibit Axin-mediated GENE1 activation ( Figure 1B ) . However MDM2Deltap53 , an OTHER_GENE mutant lacking p53-binding domain , fails to exert the inhibitory effect , indicating that the inhibition may be based on the interaction between OTHER_GENE and GENE1 ( Figure 1B ) .

GENE1 and its E3-inactivated mutant MDM2(C464A ) show the similar effect on inhibition of Axin-induced GENE2 transcriptional activity .
As GENE1 can stimulate p53 phosphorylation at Ser 46 by facilitating HIPK2 kinase activity [ 8 ] , here we tested whether this effect of GENE1 can be blocked by GENE2 . When p53 and GENE2 were co-overexpressed in H1299 cells , p53 is ubiquitinated and degraded leading to the basal level of p53 is lower than that in control cells transfected with GENE1 , p53 and blank vector ( data not shown ) , which makes it difficult to compare the difference of p53 Ser 46 phosphorylation levels between cells overexpressed with and without GENE2 . To avoid p53 degradation mediated by GENE2 , GENE2 ( C464A ) was transfected together with GENE1 and p53 . The result showed that GENE1 alone strongly activated p53 Ser 46 phosphorylation , while this effect was abrogated by co-expression of GENE2 ( C464A ) ( Figure 2A ) . This observation was confirmed by another result showing that both overexpression of GENE2 ( C464A ) and knockdown of GENE1 can decrease UV-induced p53 Ser 46 phosphorylation to the same extent ( Figure 2B ) , consistent with our previous work proved that GENE1 plays an important role in UV-induced p53 Ser 46 phosphorylation [ 8 ] . Taken together our results demonstrate that GENE2 can inhibit Axin-induced p53 phosphorylation at Ser 46 independently of it E3 ligase activity .
Overexpression of GENE1 can trigger cell to undergo apoptosis by stimulating p53 apoptosis-inducing function based on selective activation of PUMA transcription [ 9 ] . We want to know whether GENE2 can serve as an inhibitor on Axin-induced p53-dependent apoptosis . As indicated in Figure 3A , both GENE2 and GENE2 ( C464A ) can dramatically inhibit Axin-induced apoptosis in H1299 cells . Similar results were observed in U2OS cells ( Figure 3B ) .
Exo84 phosphorylation inhibits exocytosis . ( A ) Bgl2 secretion assays in the wild-type ( EXO84 ) , exo84-A , and exo84-E cells at 25 C and 34 C. The exo84-E mutant accumulates Bgl2 in the cell at 34 C. ( B ) Quantification of Bgl2 accumulation in the wild-type , exo84-A , and exo84-E cells at 25 C and 34 C. Error bars represent standard deviation . * , P < 0.01 ; n = 3 . ( C ) Thin-section EM analysis of the wild-type , exo84-A , and exo84-E cells after shifted to 34 C for 90 min .

Error bars represent standard error of the mean ( n = 35 ) . * , P < 0.01 . ( E ) Exo84 phosphorylation site mutations affect Bgl2 secretion in the GENE1 - 38 mutant background . The GENE1 GENE2 double mutants were generated and assayed as outlined in A. The GENE1 - 38 exo84-E cells displayed more pronounced Bgl2 secretion defects than corresponding GENE1 - 38 single mutant cells , whereas the GENE1 - 38 exo84-A cells displayed diminished Bgl2 secretion defects compared with the GENE1 - 38 single mutant cells . ( F ) Quantification of Bgl2 accumulation in the GENE1 - 38 EXO84 , GENE1 - 38 exo84-A , and GENE1 - 38 exo84-E mutant cells . Error bars indicate standard deviation . * , P < 0.01 ; n = 3 . ( G ) Thin-section EM analysis of the GENE1 GENE2 double mutant cells . The GENE1 - 38 exo84-A cells contain fewer secretory vesicles than GENE1 - 38 single mutant cells , whereas GENE1 - 38 exo84-E cells accumulate a larger number of secretory vesicles than GENE1 - 38 cells . Bars , 1 microm . ( H ) Quantification of accumulated vesicles in the GENE1 - 38 EXO84 , GENE1 - 38 exo84-A , and GENE1 - 38 exo84-E mutant cells . Error bars represent standard error of the mean . * , P < 0.01 ; n = 35 . ( I ) Growth of the wild-type ( EXO84 ) , exo84-A , exo84-E , GENE1 - 38 , GENE1 - 38 exo84-A , and GENE1 - 38 exo84-E cells after serial dilution on plates at 25 C and 34 C. The exo84-E cells grew poorly at 34 C compared with the wild-type and exo84-A cells . The GENE1 - 38 exo84-A cells grew better than the GENE1 - 38 single mutant , whereas GENE1 - 38 exo84-E cells displayed severe growth defects at 34 C.
The growth properties of the Exo84 mutant cells correlate with the observed secretion properties . The exo84-E mutant grew slower than the wild-type cells , whereas the exo84-A mutant grows slightly faster than wild-type EXO84 cells . Moreover , the GENE1 - 38 exo84-E double mutant cells grew more poorly than the GENE1 - 38 single mutant cells , and the GENE1 - 38 exo84-A double mutant cells showed much improved growth ( Fig. 6 I ) . In addition to GENE1 - 38 , the GENE2 phospho mutants had similar synthetic effects when combined with other exocyst mutants ( unpublished data ) . The use of double mutants allowed us to study the positive effect of exo84-A on exocytosis . To directly examine the effect of the exo84-A mutant on exocytosis , we compared media glycoprotein secretion by the wild-type and exo84-A mutant cells released from alpha-factor arrest at 30 and 90 min , respectively . At 90 min ( corresponding to metaphase ) , the secretion of a select set of glycoproteins was lower than that at 30 min ( G1 phase ; Fig. 7 ) . This correlates with the phosphorylation of Exo84 around 90 min ( Fig. 3 B ) . However , the secretion of the exo84-A mutant cell was the same for both 30 min and 90 min . Together , our data suggest that Exo84 phosphorylation plays a negative regulatory role on exocytosis .
To determine whether RSPO-LGR4 acts solely through clearance of the E3 ligases , HEK293 T cells which only express ZNRF3 ( 27 ) were transfected with ZNRF3 siRNA , and their response to Wnt3a and RSPO3 was measured . As expected ( 27 ) , knockdown ( KD ) of ZNRF3 led to increases in basal activity and in response to Wnt stimulation ( Fig. 1A ) . Surprisingly , cells with KD of ZNRF3 produced a better response to GENE1 stimulation ( Fig. 1A ) . Ectopic expression of OTHER_GENE in ZNRF3-deficient cells led to much higher basal and RSPO-stimulated GENE2 activity compared with control cells ( Fig. 1A ) . These results suggest that RSPO-LGR4 has ZNRF3-independent activity . To corroborate this finding , we generated a mutant ( Q71A ) of RSPO1 that alters residue Glu-71 , which has been shown to be critical for binding to RNF43 , but not to LGR5 , in the cocrystal structure of LGR5-RSPO1-RNF43 ( 29 ) . The RSPO1 mutant was expressed and secreted at levels similar to those of WT ( Fig. S1A ) . As expected , Q71A failed to bind to ZNRF3 but still bound to OTHER_GENE , with slightly lower affinity compared with WT ( Fig. S1 B and C ) . It should also be noted that the observed binding of WT RSPO1 to ZNRF3 was only slightly above background levels ( Fig. S1B ) . In functional assays , Q71A was weaker than WT in HEK293 T cells ( Fig. 1B ) but showed the same efficacy as WT with only ~threefold decrease in potency in cells overexpressing OTHER_GENE ( Fig. 1B ) . Furthermore , both mutant and WT RSPO1 elicited a stronger response in cells with KD of ZNRF3 ( Fig. 1C ) . The decrease in potency of the Q71A mutant in cells with or without KD of ZNRF3 or with overexpression of OTHER_GENE in potentiating Wnt/beta-catenin activity is consistent with its reduced binding affinity for OTHER_GENE ( Fig. S1C ) . These results strongly suggest that binding of GENE1 to ZNRF3 is only critical for its Wnt-potentiating effect in cells with high levels of ZNRF3 , and thus RSPO-LGR4 is likely to function via other mechanisms to enhance Wnt/beta-catenin signaling .

To corroborate this finding , we generated a mutant ( Q71A ) of RSPO1 that alters residue Glu-71 , which has been shown to be critical for binding to RNF43 , but not to LGR5 , in the cocrystal structure of LGR5-RSPO1-RNF43 ( 29 ) . The RSPO1 mutant was expressed and secreted at levels similar to those of WT ( Fig. S1A ) . As expected , Q71A failed to bind to ZNRF3 but still bound to GENE1 , with slightly lower affinity compared with WT ( Fig. S1 B and C ) . It should also be noted that the observed binding of WT RSPO1 to ZNRF3 was only slightly above background levels ( Fig. S1B ) . In functional assays , Q71A was weaker than WT in HEK293 T cells ( Fig. 1B ) but showed the same efficacy as WT with only ~threefold decrease in potency in cells overexpressing GENE1 ( Fig. 1B ) . Furthermore , both mutant and WT RSPO1 elicited a stronger response in cells with KD of ZNRF3 ( Fig. 1C ) . The decrease in potency of the Q71A mutant in cells with or without KD of ZNRF3 or with overexpression of GENE1 in potentiating Wnt/beta-catenin activity is consistent with its reduced binding affinity for GENE1 ( Fig. S1C ) . These results strongly suggest that binding of OTHER_GENE to ZNRF3 is only critical for its Wnt-potentiating effect in cells with high levels of ZNRF3 , and thus RSPO-LGR4 is likely to function via other mechanisms to enhance Wnt/beta-catenin signaling .
Loss of GENE1 restores viability of fission yeast cells lacking Hsk1 , the catalytic subunit of DDK ( Hayano et al. , 2012 ) . Similarly , we found that loss of Sc GENE1 partly suppresses the temperature sensitivity of an allele of the OTHER_GENE + budding yeast ortholog , GENE2 - 1 ( Figure 3A ) . Remarkably , rif1-PP1 was also able to partly suppress the temperature sensitivity of GENE2 - 1 , although to a lesser extent than rif1-Delta ( Figure 3A ) . Similarly to budding yeast , fission yeast rif1-PP1 also restored growth to OTHER_GENE - 89 mutants , to an extent comparable to that conferred by rif1-Delta ( Figure 3B ) . These results suggest that the Rif1-dependent recruitment of PP1 to replication origins might counteract DDK kinase activity at origins .

Because Zebrafish Kctd15 , the homolog of human GENE1 gene , inhibits neural crest formation by antagonizing the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling [ 33 ] . We next wondered whether the effect of human GENE1 on Wnt signaling pathway , a TOPFLASH reporter construct containing seven copies of the TCF binding site was employed to report the activity of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling . The reporter construct was transfected alone or together with pCMV-Myc-KCTD1 into HEK293 cells , the overexpression of GENE1 significantly inhibited the TOPFLASH luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner , while GENE1 gave no effect on the activities of the FOPFLASH reporter with six copies of mutant TCF binding sites ( Figure 1A ) . Conversely , the efficient siRNA of GENE1 knockdowned the protein level of GENE1 , but not that of siRNA-resistant GENE1 with five silent mutations ( Figure 1B ) . Moreover , the siRNA-resistant GENE1 still suppressed the TOPFLASH activity as GENE1 did . GENE1 siRNA markedly increased reporter activities , and alleviated the inhibition effect under endogenous or exogenous GENE1 . The TOPFLASH reporter activity increase was rescued when cotransfection with siRNA-resistant GENE1 and GENE1 siRNA ( Figure 1C ) . When transfected HEK293 cells were treated with GENE2 , the TOPFLASH reporter activity was significantly increased . And the expression of GENE1 dramatically decreased the TOPFLASH activity induced by GENE2 to the same level as GENE1 alone did ( Figure 1D ) . Our findings supported that GENE1 downregulates Wnt signaling pathway .
Next , luciferase analysis showed that GENE1 and KCTD1N with the BTB domain significantly suppressed the TCF/LEF transcriptional activity , but not KCTD1C without functional domains ( Figure 5A ) . Therefore , the N-terminal BTB domain of GENE1 is critical for the inhibition . Five mutants of GENE1 in SEN syndrome were constructed to identify critical amino acid residues of the BTB domain in GENE1 , we found that three GENE1 mutants ( P20S , H33P and P31R ) still inhibited the TOPFLASH reporter activities to the same extent as wild-type GENE1 did , but mutant GENE1 with A30E or H33Q had no effect on the TOPFLASH reporter transcription activities as truncated KCTD1C did , indicating that alanine at position 30 and histidine at position 33 are critical amino acid residues of GENE1 in the regulation of Wnt signaling . And protein levels of full-length , truncations and mutants of GENE1 were confirmed by Western blotting ( Figure 5B ) . Likewise , we further demonstrated that GENE2 N2 with TCF/LEF sites greatly induced the reporter activation , similar to the activation effect of full-length GENE2 . Other truncations of GENE2 gave no effect on reporter activity in the absence of the TCF/LEF sites . Furthermore , GENE1 inhibited the activation of the TCF/LEF reporter induced by full-length GENE2 as well as truncated GENE2 N2 ( Figure 5C ) . The expression of full-length and truncations of GENE2 was substantiated by Western blot ( Figure 5D ) . Therefore , pull-down assays and luciferase analysis consistently demonstrated that the 1 - 9 armadillo repeats of GENE2 and the BTB domain of GENE1 are critical regions for their interaction .
The SW480 cell line has a normal OTHER_GENE with truncated GENE1 , the GENE1 gene has a nonsense mutation at residue 1338 , which results in a predicted protein size of 147 KD while the normal GENE1 gene encodes a protein of 312 KD [ 45 ] . We found that GENE2 inhibited the TOPFLASH luciferase activity by 62 % in SW480 cell line ( data not shown ) . We next further investigated whether GENE1 was required for KCTD1-mediated degradation of OTHER_GENE . Because KCTD1-interacting protein , AP-2alpha , binds to the N terminus of GENE1 , including the heptad and armadillo repeats [ 39 ] , we constructed two N-terminus fragments of GENE1 ( a.a . 1 - 453 and 454 - 1020 ) . Overexpression of truncated GENE1 alone enhanced TOPFLASH luciferease activity , and coexpression of GENE1 truncations with GENE2 blocked the decrease of TOPFLASH reporter activity mediated by GENE2 ( Figure 9A ) . Next , we examined the effect of GENE1 truncations on beta-Catenin protein level . And the protein amount of Myc-beta-Catenin is consistent with the level of TOPFLASH reporter activity . As shown in Figure 9B , the expression of OTHER_GENE was significantly decreased by coexpression of GENE2 , while the level of OTHER_GENE was increased and stabilized when cotransfected with GENE1 truncations . Moreover , GENE1 truncations attenuated the KCTD1-induced reduction of Myc-beta-catenin . These results strongly indicated that GENE1 blocks KCTD1-mediated downregulation of OTHER_GENE .

We next investigated the effects of deleting MLH2 on MMR using the hom3 - 10 and lys2 - 10A frameshift reversion and CAN1 forward mutation rate assays ( Table 1A ) . Deletion of MLH2 alone did not cause a significant increase in mutation rate in either the frameshift reversion or forward mutation assays , in agreement with previous work [ 22 ] . We next tested if the GENE1 mutation exacerbated the defects caused by mutations in other MMR genes . The GENE1 msh3Delta or GENE1 exo1Delta double mutant strains did not exhibit mutation rates that were higher than the mutation rates of the single mutants . In contrast , the GENE1 GENE2 double mutant strain exhibited a synergistic increase in the hom3 - 10 and lys2 - 10A frameshift reversion assays but not in the CAN1 forward mutation assay that , in addition to frameshift mutations , detects base substitution mutations and other kinds of mutations [ 46 ] . Although the frameshift reversion rates of the GENE1 GENE2 double mutant were higher than that of the respective single mutants , the rates were still substantially lower than caused by the msh3Delta GENE2 double mutation that eliminates mispair recognition and causes a complete MMR defect . The combination of the specificity of MLH2 for suppressing frameshift mutations and synergy of the GENE1 mutation with the GENE2 mutation but not with the msh3Delta mutation suggests that MLH2 contributes preferentially to MSH3-dependent MMR .
Given the results of the Mlh2 localization studies , we hypothesized that Mlh2 becomes more important for MMR under conditions where the major MutL-related complex Mlh1-Pms1 is limiting . To test this idea , we took advantage of the previously reported tetracycline repressible system [ 47 ] to regulate GENE1 expression ( tetO2 promoter ) in a doxycycline-dependent manner . After titrating doxycycline , we found that 10 microg/ml of doxycycline resulted in partial downregulation of GENE1 protein expression ( Figure S1 ) and a weak MMR defect in the frameshift reversion assays but not in the CAN1 forward mutation assay ( Table 1B ) . Consistent with the hypothesis , we observed a synergistic increase in the mutation rate in the frameshift reversion assays when the GENE2 mutation was combined with reduced expression of GENE1 . Thus , Mlh2 becomes more important for MMR when the level of GENE1 is reduced , suggesting that Mlh2 normally plays an accessory role in MMR .
Because GENE1 lacks conserved endonuclease motifs and mutations abolishing pms1 endonuclease function cause a weakly dominant MMR defect that is enhanced by overexpression [ 13 ] , we tested if overexpression of GENE1 would cause an MMR defect . We therefore engineered S. cerevisiae strains in which the endogenous promoters of the GENE1 , MLH3 and GENE2 genes were replaced by the strong promoter of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene ( pGPD ) and monitored these strains for mutator phenotypes using the hom3 - 10 and lys2 - 10A frameshift reversion assays and the CAN1 forward mutation assay . Overexpression of GENE2 did not cause increased mutation rates ; however , overexpression of GENE1 or MLH3 drastically increased the mutation rates up to levels that were almost indistinguishable from an MMR defective strain ( msh3Delta msh6Delta ) ( Table 2 ) . Similar results were obtained upon the expression of these genes driven by their native promoters on high copy number plasmids in wild-type cells ( data not shown ) . The endogenous expression level of Pms1 was roughly 5 - 10-fold higher than that of either Mlh2 or Mlh3 ( Figure 5A ) , and the pGPD promoter increased the expression of each MutL homolog by > 50-fold relative to the endogenous level of Pms1 ( Figure 5B ) . The mismatch repair defect caused by the overexpression of GENE1 was largely suppressed by the simultaneous overexpression of GENE2 ( Table 2 ) . These data suggest that increasing the level of Mlh2 or Mlh3 by overexpression allows Mlh2 or Mlh3 to outcompete Pms1 for binding to the Mlh1 present in the cell , thereby preventing the formation of sufficient levels of Mlh1-Pms1 complex to support MMR , and that neither Mlh2 nor Mlh3 is sufficient to replace Pms1 function in MMR . In the case of Mlh1-Mlh2 , this is most likely because Mlh1-Mlh2 lacks endonuclease activity . In the case of Mlh1-Mlh3 , it is possible that Mlh1-Mlh3 lacks sufficient endonuclease activity to substitute for Mlh1-Pms1 or it does not function sufficiently in the Msh2-Msh6 pathway to promote MMR [ 21 ] . It is also possible that overexpression leads to much higher levels of Mlh1-Mlh2 or Mlh1-Mlh3 complexes , which then outcompete the Mlh1-Pms1 complex for a key substrate .

In this study , we found that GENE1 expression was impaired in HCC tissues and loss of GENE1 expression was correlated with poor clinicopathological features including large tumor size , venous infiltration , high pathological grading and advanced TNM stage . Additionally , we demonstrated that patients with positive GENE1 expression had a better 5-year survival and GENE1 was an independent factor for predicting the prognosis of HCC patients . We confirmed that GENE1 inhibited HCC by inducing both apoptosis and growth arrest . Elevated GENE2 expression was observed in the same cohort of HCC tissues . Pearson 's correlation coefficient analysis indicated that GENE1 was inversely associated with GENE2 protein expression in HCC tissues . We also found that GENE1 regulated GENE2 protein abundance by targeting GENE2 for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation in HCC . Furthermore , restoring GENE2 expression partially abrogated GENE1 induced HCC cell apoptosis and growth arrest in vitro and in vivo .
To determine whether the GENE1 protein participates in GENE2 induced apoptosis and growth arrest in HCC cells , GENE2 overexpressing Hep3B cells were subsequently transfected with HA-YAP . Restoring GENE1 expression in Hep3B cells partially reverted the effect of exogenous GENE2 overexpression , leading to a significant reduction in the number of apoptotic cells as well as increased cell proliferation and viability ( P < 0.01 , respectively , Figure 6 ) . We next sought to determine whether GENE2 affects tumor growth by inhibiting GENE1 using a Hep3B subcutaneous tumor model . Hep3B cells that had been infected with different retroviruses were implanted into nude mice via subcutaneous injection . Tumor growth curves , generated over 21 days , revealed that GENE2 overexpression slowed down Hep3B tumor growth in mice . Restoring GENE1 expression partially restored tumor growth , for the Fbxw7-overexpressing Hep3B cells ( P < 0.01 , Figure 7A ) . We performed immunohistochemistry for GENE1 and Ki-67 as well as TUNEL assays in the xenografted tissues . As expected , GENE2 overexpression down-regulated GENE1 protein expression , inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in vivo . GENE1 partially abolished the inhibiting effect of GENE2 on HCC growth ; it led to a significant reduction in the number of apoptotic cells and increased the number of cells staining positive for Ki-67 , which is consistent with our in vitro observations ( P < 0.05 or P < 0.01 , respectively , Figure 7B ) . Taken together , these data indicate that GENE1 may function as a downstream factor in GENE2 induced apoptosis and growth arrest in HCC .
GENE1 's suppression of Hep3B cell growth was partially reverted by GENE2 . A ) Flag-Fbxw7 transfected Hep3B cells successfully up-regulated GENE1 protein expression as shown by western blot . GENE1 overexpression in the same cell line could reduce the levels of GENE2 . GENE1 over-expressing cells that were transfected with HA-YAP partially rescued the phenotype , showing higher GENE2 levels . The data are representative of multiple repeats with similar results . B ) Apoptotic cells were measured by flow cytometry . Restoring GENE2 expression decreased the percentage of apoptotic cells in Flag-Fbxw7 transfected Hep3B cells . * * P < 0.01 by one-way ANOVA ; n = 3 repeats with similar results . C ) The activity of the pro-apoptotic caspases 3 and 7 in GENE1 overexpressing Hep3B cells was decreased by HA-YAP transfection . * * P < 0.01 by one-way ANOVA ; n = 3 repeats with similar results . D ) A BrdU assay showed that GENE2 promotes proliferation in GENE1 overexpressing Hep3B cells . * * P < 0.01 by one-way ANOVA ; n = 3 repeats with similar results . E ) GENE2 was found to enhance the viability of GENE1 over-expressing Hep3B cells ( MTT assay ) . * * P < 0.01 by two-way ANOVA ; n = 3 repeats with similar results .

GENE1 partially abolishes GENE2 's suppression of tumor growth . A ) Control Hep3B cells ( EV , n = 6 ) , GENE2 overexpressing Hep3B cells ( Flag-Fbxw7 , n = 6 ) and co-expressing Hep3B cells ( Flag-Fbxw7 + HA-YAP , n = 6 ) , respectively , were implanted into nude mice via subcutaneous injection . Tumor nodules were measured using a caliper at different times after implantation . GENE2 overexpressing Hep3B cells exhibited a greater tumor-inhibiting effect compared with control cells ; however , restoring GENE1 expression accelerated tumor growth , compared with the Flag-Fbxw7 group . * * P < 0.01 by two-way ANOVA . B ) Tumor nodules were subjected to immunohistochemical staining for GENE1 and Ki-67 , TUNEL assays and quantitative analysis . Representative immunostaining and TUNEL assays revealed that GENE2 overexpression significantly reduced the number of GENE1 and Ki-67 positive cells and increased the number of apoptotic cells . However , the percentage of GENE1 and Ki-67 positive cells in tumors arising from the Flag-Fbxw7 + HA-YAP group was significantly higher than that in the tumors from the Flag-Fbxw7 group and the percentage of apoptotic cells in the Flag-Fbxw7 + HA-YAP group was significantly lower than that in the Flag-Fbxw7 group . Black arrows indicate positive cells in each photomicrograph . Scale bar : 100 mum ; n = 6 ; Values are depicted as the Mean + - SEM ; * P < 0.05 and * * P < 0.01 by one-way ANOVA .
In summary , this study shows that GENE1 expression is impaired in cancer tissues as compared with noncancerous tissues and that reduced GENE1 levels are correlated with poor clinicopathological features in HCC . Furthermore , we demonstrate that GENE1 is an independent factor for predicting the overall 5-year survival and disease-free survival of HCC patients . In vitro studies found that GENE1 inhibits HCC growth via inducing apoptosis and growth arrest . Elevated GENE2 expression is observed in HCC tissues and its expression is inversely associated with GENE1 . Importantly , our data , for the first time , indicate that GENE1 inversely regulates GENE2 protein abundance by promoting GENE2 for ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation in HCC . Our results confirm that GENE2 is a candidate oncogene because it plays a critical role in hepatocarcinogenesis . Interestingly , restoring GENE2 can partially abolish the effect of GENE1 on anti-HCC , suggesting that GENE1 may exert its tumor suppressive function by regulating the stability of the GENE2 protein . This study reveals a potential target of GENE1 and supplies us with a new insight into the accumulation of GENE2 in HCC . GENE1 may potentially act as a clinical biomarker , and may also be a therapeutic target , in HCC .
GENE1 and GENE2 Increase p65-Dependent Transactivation .
The OTHER_GENE signaling pathway is known to regulate OTHER_GENE transcriptional activity ( 1 ) . We therefore postulated that the expression of GENE1 would cause increased OTHER_GENE transcriptional activity . To test this hypothesis , we examined OTHER_GENE transcriptional activity in a cotransfection assay employing a luciferase reporter gene that contains three OTHER_GENE sites cloned upstream of a minimal promoter element ( 26 ) . Expression of GENE2 , GENE1 , or OTHER_GENE did not cause marked changes in OTHER_GENE reporter gene expression ( Fig. 5A ) . In contrast , coexpression of GENE1 with OTHER_GENE caused increased AP-1-dependent reporter gene expression . Consistent with the observation that GENE2 causes a lower level of activation of OTHER_GENE than GENE1 ( Fig. 4 ) , coexpression of GENE2 with OTHER_GENE caused a smaller increase in OTHER_GENE reporter gene expression ( Fig. 5A ) . Together , these data demonstrate that GENE1 can function as an activator of the OTHER_GENE signal transduction pathway .

In contrast , coexpression of OTHER_GENE with OTHER_GENE caused increased AP-1-dependent reporter gene expression . Consistent with the observation that OTHER_GENE causes a lower level of activation of GENE1 than OTHER_GENE ( Fig. 4 ) , coexpression of OTHER_GENE with GENE1 caused a smaller increase in GENE2 reporter gene expression ( Fig. 5A ) . Together , these data demonstrate that OTHER_GENE can function as an activator of the GENE1 signal transduction pathway .
The GENE1 signaling pathway is known to regulate OTHER_GENE transcriptional activity ( 1 ) . We therefore postulated that the expression of OTHER_GENE would cause increased OTHER_GENE transcriptional activity . To test this hypothesis , we examined OTHER_GENE transcriptional activity in a cotransfection assay employing a luciferase reporter gene that contains three OTHER_GENE sites cloned upstream of a minimal promoter element ( 26 ) .

To further examine the effect of GENE1 on transcriptional activity , we investigated the effect of GENE1 on the transcription factor ATF2 . Previous studies have demonstrated that ATF2 is a target of the JNK signal transduction pathway ( 9 - 11 ) . JNK phosphorylates two sites ( Thr-69 and Thr-71 ) in the NH2-terminal activation domain of ATF2 and increases transcriptional activity . We employed a GAL4 fusion protein strategy to monitor the transcriptional activity of the activation domain of ATF2 ( 10 ) . Measurement of reporter gene expression demonstrated that the coexpression of OTHER_GENE with GENE2 caused increased transcriptional activity ( Fig. 5B ) . A similar level of reporter gene expression was caused by expression of GENE1 and a larger increase was detected when GENE1 was coexpressed with GENE2 . The more potent effect of GENE1 , compared with OTHER_GENE , on transcriptional activity is consistent with the relative effects of GENE1 and OTHER_GENE on JNK activation ( Fig. 4 ) . To confirm that the increased reporter gene expression is mediated by ATF2 phosphorylation , we examined the effect of replacement of the sites of ATF2 phosphorylation ( Thr-69 and Thr-71 ) with Ala. The mutated ATF2 protein was not regulated by OTHER_GENE , GENE1 , or GENE2 ( Fig. 5B ) . Together , these data demonstrate that GENE1 can regulate a physiological target of the JNK signaling pathway .

GENE1 Restores the Cytoskeletal Polarization of GENE2 - 1 Cells .
Mutant GENE1 - 1 cells have a disorganized cytoskeleton . Cortical patches are distributed randomly between mother and bud , no concentration of patches can be detected during any phase of the cell cycle , and no actin cables are visible . The defect is more severe when cells are grown on nonfermentable carbon sources ( see mitochondrial defects below ) , even at permissive temperatures ( Zoladek et al. , 1995 ) . To determine whether additional actin corrects the defects in actin cytoskeleton organization , cells were grown on lactate medium at the permissive temperature , fixed , and stained with rhodamine phalloidin . Wild-type cells transformed with vector alone have polarized cytoskeletons ( Fig. 1 , a and b ) , whereas mutant GENE1 - 1 cells bearing the vector alone have shape alterations and a random distribution of cortical patches between mother and bud ( Fig. 1 , c and d ) . In contrast , GENE1 - 1 cells bearing pT3 , encoding GENE2 , have a wild-type morphology and polarized distribution of cortical patches between the mother and the bud ( Fig. 1 , e and f ) . Therefore , a two to fourfold increase in the intracellular concentration of actin confers polarized cytoskeleton and normal shape to GENE1 - 1 cells .
GENE1 Corrects the Endocytosis Defects of GENE2 - 1 Cells .
Cells with mutations in VRP1 are defective in endocytosis ( Munn et al. , 1995 ; Zoladek et al. , 1997 ) . It is known ( Benedetti et al. , 1994 ; Munn et al. , 1995 ) that the OTHER_GENE cytoskeleton plays an essential role in the internalization step of endocytosis in yeast . Many cytoskeletal proteins , such as OTHER_GENE , Sac6p , calmodulin , End3p , End4p , and type I myosins ( Geli and Riezman , 1996 ) are necessary for endocytic traffic . To determine whether the defect in endocytosis of GENE1 mutant cells is related to OTHER_GENE cytoskeleton defects , we studied fluid phase endocytosis ( Dulic et al. , 1991 ) of GENE1 cells in the presence or absence of the centromere-containing plasmid encoding OTHER_GENE . Parental cells ( strain T8.1D ) accumulate Lucifer yellow in vacuoles ( Fig. 2 , A and B ) , whereas GENE1 - 1 mutant cells do not accumulate any detectable levels of this compound ( Fig. 2 , C and D ) . However , mutant cells containing GENE2 show accumulation of Lucifer yellow in vacuoles in a manner indistinguishable from wild-type cells ( Fig. 2 , E and F ) . Therefore , an increase in the intracellular quantity of OTHER_GENE suppresses the endocytosis defect caused by the GENE1 - 1 mutation .

GENE1 Partially Corrects the Mitochondrial Defects of GENE2 - 1 Cells .
Mutant GENE1 - 1 cells have defects in mitochondrial function as assessed by their inability to grow on nonfermentable carbon sources at temperatures exceeding 30 C ( Table II ) . In contrast , GENE1 - 1 mutant cells grow well at 30 , 34 , and 35 C and poorly at 37 or 38 C on glucose-containing media . GENE2 - 1 mutant cells provided with additional OTHER_GENE grow on glycerol-containing media at temperatures from 30 to 36 C , but not at 38 C ( Table II ) . Therefore , a two- to fourfold increase in OTHER_GENE levels partially restores mitochondrial function to GENE1 - 1 mutants .

To determine if additional Act1p affects the delivery of proteins to mitochondria , we assessed the functional levels of cytosolic Mod5p-I. Mod5p is a tRNA isopentenyl transferase that modifies tRNAs . Cytosolic levels of Mod5p can be assessed by studying the levels of modified tRNA Tyr UAA , which in turn are monitored by assaying nonsense suppression of the lys2 - 1 allele ( Zoladek et al. , 1995 ) . Mod5p-I , KR6 is a form of Mod5p-I , with an alteration that provides its quantitative delivery to mitochondria . Parental cells ( strain T8.1D ) harboring the plasmid-encoding Mod5p-I , KR6 deliver the great majority of Mod5p-I , KR6 to mitochondria . As these cells do not have sufficient cytosolic Mod5p-I , KR6 to modify the tRNA Tyr UAA encoded by SUP11 , they can not grow on media lacking lysine ( lys- ) . In contrast , GENE1 - 1 cells ( strain TZ33 ) bearing the plasmid encoding Mod5p-I , KR6 , grow on lys- media . We analyzed the growth on lys- media of GENE1 - 1 mutant cells with and without a centromere-containing plasmid encoding actin . Parental cells ( strain T8.1D ) bearing YCpLEUMod5p-I , KR6ET and a control centromere-containing plasmid encoding URA3 alone are able to grow on ura-leu- media ( Fig. 3 a ) , but not on ura-leu-lys- ( Fig. 3 d ) . By contrast , GENE1 - 1 cells bearing YCpLEUMod5p-I , KR6ET and the control URA3 plasmid are able to grow on both ura-leu- ( Fig 3 c ) and ura-leu-lys- media ( Fig. 3 f ) . Although able to grow well on ura-leu- media ( Fig. 3 b ) GENE1 - 1 cells bearing YCp LEUMod5p-I , KR6ET and pT3 containing GENE2 show an intermediate phenotype on ura-leu-lys- media ( Fig. 3 e ) . Thus , the partial suppression of the Lys+ phenotype in GENE1 - 1 cells indicates that excess actin causes a decrease in the functional cytoplasmic pool of Mod5p-I , KR6 .
Our studies of fluid phase endocytosis are consistent with other observations that some , but not all , cytoskeletal mutations show defects in endocytosis ( Munn et al. , 1995 ; Wendland et al. , 1996 ; Zoladek et al. , 1997 ; ) . Our data support the involvement of the GENE1 cytoskeleton and , more probably , cortical GENE1 patches as components of the endocytic machinery . Restoration of endocytosis in GENE2 - 1 mutant cells by additional GENE1 indicates that their endocytosis defect is most likely a direct consequence of a defective cytoskeleton .
GENE1 supplied from a centromere-containing plasmid also partially corrects the GENE2 - 1 mitochondrial deficiency as assessed by growth on nonfermentable carbon sources , and restores near parental cytoplasmic levels of Mod5p-I , KR6 as assessed by nonsense suppression studies . The involvement of the actin cytoskeleton with delivery of proteins to mitochondria and with mitochondrial function implicates a novel function for the actin cytoskeleton . Ideas as to how mitochondria and the cytoskeleton might interrelate are outlined below .
Cytoskeletal polarization is restored in GENE1 - 1 cells ( strain TZ33 ) by two- to fourfold increases in the level of GENE2 . Representative cells of wild-type strain T8.1D bearing an empty plasmid in a and b ; GENE1 - 1 mutant cells ( strain TZ33 ) bearing an empty plasmid in c and d ; and GENE1 - 1 cells plus ACT1 on the centromere-containing plasmid pT3 in e and f. Cells were grown on 2 % lactate medium at permissive temperature , fixed as described ( Adams and Pringle , 1991 ) and then stained with rhodamine-phalloidin for 1 h. Bar , 3 mum .
Fluid-phase endocytosis is restored in GENE1 - 1 cells ( strain TZ33 ) by additional GENE2 . Lucifer yellow uptake in wild-type ( strain T8.1D ) cells transformed with vector alone in A and B ; GENE1 - 1 mutant cells bearing vector alone ( C and D ) ; and GENE1 - 1 cells bearing ACT1 on pT3 plasmid ( E and F ) . Cells were grown at permissive temperature and then incubated with Lucifer yellow for 2 h. ( A , C , and E ) , FITC channel . In B , D , and F , the same cells visualized under DIC . Bar , 3 mum .
Extra GENE1 partially suppresses the Lys+ phenotype of GENE2 - 1 cells . The plate in the left is ura-leu- and the one in the right is ura-leu-lys- . Parental T8.1D cells ( a and d ) ; GENE2 - 1 cells ( strain TZ33 ) , ( c and f ) ; GENE2 - 1 cells bearing pT3 ( encoding GENE1 ) ( b and e ) . All strains have Mod5-I , KR6ET gene on a centromere-containing plasmid ; the ura-leu- master plate was first replica plated to ura-leu-lys- plate and then to ura-leu- plate . For all strains , growth was assessed at 23 C.
In the present work , we demonstrate that OTHER_GENE is a coactivator for AR-dependent transactivation . Moreover , competition for intracellular OTHER_GENE is responsible , at least in part , for repression of GENE1 activity by OTHER_GENE and for mutual transcriptional interference between OTHER_GENE and NF-kappaB ( GENE2 ) .

The ability of OTHER_GENE to modulate AR-mediated transcription was studied in CV-1 cells , which do not express endogenous receptor protein . Coexpression of OTHER_GENE with GENE1 increased the activity of a reporter gene driven by four AREs in front of the minimal thymidine kinase promoter ( pARE4tk-LUC ) by 3.5-fold over that with GENE1 alone in the presence of testosterone ( P < 0.005 ; Fig. 1A ) . Overexpression of OTHER_GENE also enhanced slightly transcriptional activity of GENE2 in the absence of hormone . Basal promoter activity was not affected by OTHER_GENE ( Fig. 1A ) . Comparable results were obtained with other reporters regulated by GENE2 , such as pARE2-E1b-CAT and the rat probasin gene proximal promoter ( ref . 31 and unpublished results ) , indicating that the effect of OTHER_GENE on GENE2 function was not a feature specific for a given promoter/reporter construct . One possible mechanism for CBP-mediated enhancement of GENE2 function is an increase in the amount of receptor protein . This was , however , not the case , as illustrated by immunoblotting experiments on extracts isolated from cells transfected with pSG5-rAR in the presence or absence of pSG5-CBP ( Fig. 1B ) .

GENE1 and OTHER_GENE can inhibit each other 's transcriptional activity , and the mutual inhibition is not due to a strong physical interaction between the two proteins or their altered binding to cognate DNA elements ( 30 ) . The mutual repression between GENE1 and OTHER_GENE could thus originate from competition for coregulators , such as CBP/p300 . To test this possibility , CV-1 cells were cotransfected with GENE1 , OTHER_GENE , GENE2 expression vectors , and the pARE4tk-LUC reporter . Under these conditions , already low amounts of OTHER_GENE inhibited transactivation by GENE1 to one-third . The repression was abolished by cotransfected GENE2 ( Fig. 7 ) . The ability of GENE2 to abrogate inhibition of OTHER_GENE activity by GENE1 was next investigated . In CV-1 cells , expression of OTHER_GENE elicited a 10-fold increase in pkappaB6tk-LUC activity , and this was enhanced 2.5-fold by coexpression of GENE2 ( Fig. 8A ) . Liganded GENE1 down-regulated RelA-induced reporter gene activity by more than 50 % , and GENE2 coexpression rescued this repression ( P < 0.05 ) . GENE2 did not increase significantly basal reporter gene activity ( Fig. 8A ) .

Our previous study ( 30 ) indicated that transrepression between rAR and OTHER_GENE does not involve LBD or most of the N-terminal region of rAR but that the region between residue 297 and the DNA-binding domain of GENE1 is mandatory ( 30 ) . In view of this , we also tested an rAR mutant devoid of LBD and N-terminal residues 38 - 296 ( rARDelta38 - 296/Delta641 - 902 ) . The mutant GENE1 form repressed RelA-induced pkappaB6tk-LUC expression to an extent similar to that of wild-type GENE1 ; this repression was relieved by coexpression of GENE2 ( Fig. 8B ) . Thus , GENE2 is involved in the mutual transcriptional repression between GENE1 and RelA. The results with rARDelta38 - 296/Delta641 - 902 also provided additional evidence for the notion that LBD of GENE1 is not mandatory for the receptor 's interaction with GENE2 .

Previous studies have shown that GENE1 enhances transcriptional activity of several members of the nuclear receptor superfamily ( 24 - 28 ) . In those experiments , GENE1 was found to interact with LBD of the receptors . This work shows , however , that GENE1 augments AR-mediated transactivation independent of the presence of LBD ( mutant rARDelta641 - 902 ) or LBD and N-terminal residues 38 - 296 ( mutant rARDelta38 - 296/Delta641 - 902 ) . The two GENE2 mutants devoid of LBD have an intact DNA binding domain and approximately one-half of the hinge region residues 607 - 659 ( 51 ) . The LBD of GENE2 was not mandatory for the receptor 's ability to compete for available intracellular GENE1 with members of the AP-1 and NF-kappaB transcription factor families . Even though these results do not necessarily rule out the possibility that LBD contacts GENE1 , they demonstrate nevertheless that LBD is not the only region of GENE2 that interacts with GENE1 . Residues 38 - 296 that were also dispensable for AR-CBP interaction contain the AF-1 region of GENE2 , which is mandatory for the transactivation ability of the native receptor ( 29 ) and possibly interacts with the general transcription factor TFIIF ( 7 ) . We have previously shown that GENE1 is capable of facilitating the interaction between N and C termini of rAR ( 31 ) , which may explain the result that GENE1 activated wild-type GENE2 twice as much as LBD-deficient GENE2 forms ( compare Figs. 1 and 3 ) . Thus , these findings indicate that the AR-CBP interaction is a complex event that may involve multiple interaction interfaces on both proteins .
We have demonstrated previously that OTHER_GENE and the GENE1 subunit of NF-kappaB can interfere with each other 's transcriptional activity ( 30 ) . Similar observations have been reported for GR and estrogen receptor ( 55 , 56 ) . Already very low amounts of GENE1 inhibited AR-mediated transactivation and excess GENE1 was capable of rescuing the repression elicited by OTHER_GENE , whereas excess OTHER_GENE could not relieve the repression brought about by GENE1 ( 30 ) . These results suggested that OTHER_GENE and GENE1 use a common coregulator , the affinity of which for GENE1 exceeds that for OTHER_GENE , and competition for this coregulator results in the mutual transcriptional repression . We show herein that GENE2 stimulates transcriptional activity of both OTHER_GENE and GENE1 and that GENE2 rescues the mutual transrepression . This implies that GENE2 is a coactivator present in limiting amounts in cells and subject to competition by OTHER_GENE and RelA. Indeed , while this work was in progress , it was reported that the transcriptional activation domain of GENE1 interacts with CBP/p300 ( 22 , 23 ) . In summary , GENE2 acts as an integrator between androgen-dependent and other nuclear signaling pathways and , therefore , regulation of GENE2 expression should be of great importance in determining transcriptional responses to androgens and other regulators of nuclear signaling .
We have demonstrated previously that GENE1 and the GENE2 subunit of NF-kappaB can interfere with each other 's transcriptional activity ( 30 ) . Similar observations have been reported for GR and estrogen receptor ( 55 , 56 ) . Already very low amounts of GENE2 inhibited AR-mediated transactivation and excess GENE2 was capable of rescuing the repression elicited by GENE1 , whereas excess GENE1 could not relieve the repression brought about by GENE2 ( 30 ) .

GENE1 stimulates AR-mediated transactivation without altering the amount of receptor protein . ( A ) CV-1 cells ( 0.5 x 106 cells per 60-mm dish ) were transfected with pARE4tk-LUC ( 1.5 mug ) , GENE2 expression vector ( pSG5-rAR , 0.3 mug ) , and GENE1 expression plasmid ( pSG5-CBP , 3 mug ) . The total amount of DNA was kept constant by adding empty pSG5 DNA when appropriate . Eighteen hours after transfection , the cells received fresh medium with vehicle or 25 nM testosterone ( T ) as indicated . After a 30-h culture , the cells were harvested and LUC activity was determined . Reporter gene activities are expressed relative to that achieved with pSG5-rAR in the presence of testosterone , and data are the mean + - SEM of three experiments given as percentages . ( B ) COS-1 cells were transfected by electroporation with pSG5-rAR with or without pSG5-CBP . Control cells received empty pSG5 DNA . After transfection , the cells were cultured for 30 h in the presence or absence of 25 nM testosterone , after which soluble cell extracts were prepared and subjected for immunoblotting with ARp3 antibody ( 30 ) .
GENE1 rescues RelA-mediated repression of GENE2 function . CV-1 cells were transfected with pARE4tk-LUC reporter ( 5 mug ) and indicated amounts ( in mug ) of pCMV-hAR , pCMV-RelA , and pSG5-CBP vectors in the absence or presence of 25 nM testosterone ( T ) as indicated . The cells were treated and harvested as described in Fig. 1 . LUC activities are expressed relative to that of human GENE2 plus testosterone , and data are the mean + - SEM of two experiments .
GENE1 stimulates RelA-dependent transactivation and counteracts AR-mediated repression of GENE2 function . ( A ) CV-1 cells were transfected with pkappaB6tk-LUC reporter ( 5 mug ) , pCMV-hAR ( 1 mug ) , pCMV-RelA ( 1 mug ) , and pSG5-CBP ( 10 mug ) expression vectors . For the relative LUC activity , GENE2 alone was set at 100 . Testosterone ( 25 nM ) was present in all cultures . Data are the mean + - SEM of four experiments are shown . ( B ) CV-1 cells were transfected with expression vectors for pCMV-RelA ( 1 mug ) , pSG5-rARDelta38 - 296/Delta641 - 902 ( 1 mug ) , and pSG5-CBP ( 10 mug ) and with pkappaB6tk-LUC reporter . Data are the mean + - SEM of two experiments .
To begin to elucidate the physiological function of OTHER_GENE , an expression construct producing OTHER_GENE was introduced into human kidney epithelial 293 T cells and subsequently observed for features of apoptosis . Expression of OTHER_GENE did not induce apoptosis of 293 T cells ( data not shown ) . Because the N-terminal region of OTHER_GENE exhibited homology to the prodomains of several apical caspases , we reasoned that OTHER_GENE might regulate the killing activity of caspases . To test that , plasmids producing several caspases known to activate cell death were coexpressed with OTHER_GENE in 293 T cells . Expression of OTHER_GENE inhibited apoptosis induced by GENE1 and C. elegans GENE2 ( P < 0.01 ) but not that mediated by caspase-9 ( Fig. 3A ) . Further experiments revealed that OTHER_GENE inhibited caspase-8-induced killing in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig. 3B ) .

In the current work we describe OTHER_GENE , a protein containing a CARD that functions as an inhibitor of apoptosis . The inhibitory effect of OTHER_GENE is selective in that it repressed apoptosis induced by caspase-8 and C. elegans CED-3 , but not that mediated by caspase-9 .

Previous studies have identified several genes whose products are required for the correct trafficking of the vacuolar hydrolase receptor , Vps10p . Strains carrying mutations in the VPS35 , OTHER_GENE , or VPS30 genes have phenotypes that are virtually indistinguishable , and cause Vps10p to become mislocalized to the vacuolar membrane ( Seaman et al. , 1997 ) . Detailed analysis of the vps35 mutant strongly suggested that a defect in the retrieval of Vps10p from the prevacuolar endosome to the late-Golgi was responsible for the vacuolar protein-sorting defect ( Seaman et al. , 1997 ) . The very similar phenotypes of the vps35 , vps29 , and vps30 mutants suggested that the gene products may all function at a common step in the retrieval pathway . To test this directly and to gain a better understanding of the roles that the VPS35 , OTHER_GENE , and VPS30 genes play in the retrieval of Vps10p , a dominant negative mutant of VPS35 ( GENE1 ) was generated . When introduced at high copy number into wild-type cells , this allele caused a significant defect in the trafficking of CPY to the vacuole , resulting in 50 % of the CPY being secreted from the cell as the Golgi-modified p2 precursor form ( Fig. 1 A , lanes 1 and 2 ) . Effects of dominant negative alleles are often due to titration of other factors by the dominant negative protein . Candidates for these other factors in this case would clearly include OTHER_GENE and/or Vps30p . Therefore , the strain carrying the GENE1 allele was transformed with high-copy plasmids to overexpress either the OTHER_GENE , VPS30 , or VPS35 gene products . Only cells overexpressing OTHER_GENE were able to suppress the CPY sorting defect caused by the GENE1 allele ( Fig. 1 A , lanes 3 and 4 ) . These data suggest an interaction between GENE2 and OTHER_GENE .

To test this directly and to gain a better understanding of the roles that the VPS35 , GENE1 , and VPS30 genes play in the retrieval of Vps10p , a dominant negative mutant of VPS35 ( OTHER_GENE ) was generated . When introduced at high copy number into wild-type cells , this allele caused a significant defect in the trafficking of CPY to the vacuole , resulting in 50 % of the CPY being secreted from the cell as the Golgi-modified p2 precursor form ( Fig. 1 A , lanes 1 and 2 ) . Effects of dominant negative alleles are often due to titration of other factors by the dominant negative protein . Candidates for these other factors in this case would clearly include OTHER_GENE and/or Vps30p . Therefore , the strain carrying the OTHER_GENE allele was transformed with high-copy plasmids to overexpress either the GENE1 , VPS30 , or VPS35 gene products . Only cells overexpressing GENE1 were able to suppress the CPY sorting defect caused by the OTHER_GENE allele ( Fig. 1 A , lanes 3 and 4 ) . These data suggest an interaction between GENE2 and OTHER_GENE .
Previous studies have identified several genes whose products are required for the correct trafficking of the vacuolar hydrolase receptor , Vps10p . Strains carrying mutations in the VPS35 , GENE1 , or VPS30 genes have phenotypes that are virtually indistinguishable , and cause Vps10p to become mislocalized to the vacuolar membrane ( Seaman et al. , 1997 ) .

We report a novel connection between nuclear pore complexes ( NPCs ) and spindle pole bodies ( SPBs ) revealed by our studies of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae GENE1 gene . Although both NPCs and SPBs are embedded in the nuclear envelope ( NE ) in yeast , their known functions are quite distinct . Previous work demonstrated that GENE1 function is required for proper SPB duplication ( Winey , M. , M.A. Hoyt , C. Chan , L. Goetsch , D. Botstein , and B. Byers . 1993 . J. Cell Biol . 122:743 - 751 ) . Here , we show that Ndc1p is a membrane protein of the NE that localizes to both NPCs and SPBs . Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy shows that Ndc1p displays punctate , nuclear peripheral localization that colocalizes with a known NPC component , Nup49p . Additionally , distinct spots of Ndc1p localization colocalize with a known SPB component , Spc42p . Immunoelectron microscopy shows that Ndc1p localizes to the regions of NPCs and SPBs that interact with the NE . The NPCs in ndc1 - 1 mutant cells appear to function normally at the nonpermissive temperature . Finally , we have found that a deletion of GENE2 , which encodes an abundant but nonessential nucleoporin , suppresses the SPB duplication defect associated with a mutation in the GENE1 gene . We show that Ndc1p is a shared component of NPCs and SPBs and propose a shared function in the assembly of these organelles into the NE .
We show here that Ndc1p expressed at endogenous levels localizes to both NPCs and SPBs . Additionally , we have found that a deletion of GENE1 suppresses the GENE2 - 1 SPB duplication defect . Our results uncover a previously unknown link between two NE-embedded organelles , NPCs and SPBs .
A Deletion of GENE1 Suppresses the GENE2 - 1 SPB Duplication Defect
Unexpectedly , we found that the GENE1 null allele suppressed the GENE2 - 1 cold-sensitive phenotype . GENE2 - 1 strains containing the GENE1 null allele were able to grow on plates incubated at 15 C , the nonpermissive temperature for GENE2 - 1 ( Fig. 6 A ) . This suppression was due specifically to a loss of POM152 , because when a plasmid-borne copy of POM152 was reintroduced into the double mutant strain , the GENE2 - 1 cold-sensitive phenotype was restored ( Fig. 6 A ) . Additionally , this suppression is specific for the GENE2 - 1 allele , because the GENE1 null allele could not function as a bypass suppressor of the GENE2 null allele ( data not shown ) .
NDC1 function is required for SPB duplication in the first cell cycle after release from a G1 arrest induced by treatment with alpha-factor ( Winey et al. , 1993 ) . We tested whether the deletion of POM152 suppresses the GENE1 - 1 SPB duplication defect in the first cell cycle after a shift to the nonpermissive temperature . Cells were arrested in G1 at the permissive temperature using alpha-factor , and released into prechilled media at the nonpermissive temperature for GENE1 - 1 . Wild-type cells synchronously released from the G1 arrest , completed the cell cycle , and eventually became asynchronous ( Fig. 6 B ) . In contrast , GENE1 - 1 cells synchronously released from the G1 arrest , but then arrested with a G2 DNA content and large buds due to failed SPB duplication in the first cell cycle ( Fig. 6 B ) . The GENE1 - 1 , GENE2 null double mutant strains did not exhibit the GENE1 - 1 cell cycle arrest ; they appeared similar to the wild-type cultures ( Fig. 6 B ) . We conclude that the GENE2 null allele suppresses the GENE1 - 1 SPB duplication defect in the first cell cycle .
Until now , only synthetic lethal interactions have been observed when the pom152 null allele is combined with mutations in a number of NPC components ( Aitchison et al. , 1995b ; Nehrbass et al. , 1996 ) . We report that the removal of GENE1 , one of the most abundant NPC components , strongly suppresses the GENE2 - 1 SPB duplication defect . In fact , this deletion suppresses the GENE2 - 1 SPB duplication defect within the first cell cycle after a shift to the nonpermissive temperature . Because a function for Ndc1p at NPCs has not been determined , we do not know if the suppression of GENE2 - 1 by the pom152 null allele has any functional consequence for NPCs . Nonetheless , this suppression lends support to the idea that SPBs and NPCs are somehow linked , perhaps in some mechanistic way beyond shared components .
Deletion of GENE1 suppresses the GENE2 - 1 SPB duplication defect in the first cell cycle . ( A ) GENE2 - 1 or GENE2 - 1 , pom152 null double mutant strains [ HC5 - 31c and HC5 - 31c(1166 ) , respectively ; Table I ] containing pURA3-NDC1 ( pALR10-NDC1 , see Materials and Methods ) or lacking pURA3-NDC1 were transformed with either pRS315 ( pLEU2 ) or pPM1-HA ( pLEU2-POM152 ) and were streaked to a 15 C Leu- plate . All strains containing pURA3-NDC1 were able to grow at the nonpermissive temperature . The GENE2 - 1 strain lacking pURA3-NDC1 failed to grow . However , the GENE2 - 1 , pom152 null double mutant strain grew at 15 C when it contained the pLEU2 vector ( * ) . When a plasmid-borne copy of GENE1 ( pLEU2-POM152 ) was reintroduced , the double mutant strain exhibited the GENE2 - 1 cold-sensitive phenotype ( * * ) .

Asynchronous cultures ( 0:00 , dashed lines ) were arrested in G1 ( 1c DNA content ; G2 and M cells have 2c DNA content ) by treatment with alpha-factor at the permissive temperature ( 0:00 , bold line ) ( see Materials and Methods ) . Cells were released from this arrest into media at the nonpermissive temperature for GENE2 - 1 for 19.5 h ( 19:30 ) .
