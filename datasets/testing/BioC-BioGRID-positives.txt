GENE1 Binds GENE2
To assay potential interactions by the yeast two-hybrid assay, GENE1 was fused to  the lexA DNA-binding domain (pKR37) and GENE2 was  fused to an acidic activation domain (pPE81).
Induction of beta-galactosidase was observed when the GENE1 and GENE2 fusions  were coexpressed, but not when expressed alone (Table  IV).

The EH-mediated Interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 Is Required in the Rev Export Pathway
Binding of GENE1 to the EH domains of GENE2 depends on the presence of four NPF (asparagine-proline-phenylalanine)-containing motifs in its COOH terminus (Salcini et al. 1997).
However, HA-GENE1-NPV could no longer be coimmunoprecipitated with GENE2 (Fig. 3 A, top, compare lane 7 with 9).
We have previously shown that the EH domains are necessary and sufficient for binding of GENE1 to GENE2 (Salcini et al. 1997).
Thus the EH-mediated interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 is required for their synergistic effect in the Rev export pathway.
The above results suggest that the action of a GENE1-GENE2 complex must somehow be exerted at the cytosolic level.
We further showed that OTHER_GENE and GENE1 synergize with OTHER_GENE (and GENE2) in the control of Rev activity and that they do so through their EH-mediated physical interaction.

GENE1 displays SET domain-dependent physical association with the anti-phosphatase GENE2. (A) 293t cells were cotransfected with expression constructs encoding HA-tagged GENE1, GENE2, and GENE2HCS as indicated above the gel lanes.
We immunoprecipitated the APC from alpha factor-arrested cells with antibodies raised against GENE1, a nonessential component of the APC (Hwang and Murray 1997), and measured its ability to ubiquitinate an iodinated fragment of sea urchin GENE2 in a reconstituted ubiquitination assay (Charles et al. 1998).

Equal amounts of APC was immunoprecipitated from all three strains, but in GENE1-VF cells there was less associated GENE2 (Fig. 8), even though the total level of GENE2 was similar in wild-type and GENE1-VF.
The defect in the exit from mitosis in GENE1-VF is correlated with reduced binding of GENE2 to the APC and lower GENE2-dependent APC activity.

GENE1 Phosphorylates GENE2 at a Single Site in the COOH Terminus
As shown in Fig. 1 c, deletion of the most COOH-terminal sequence (Delta1) or point mutations of the predicted phosphorylation site (S411A) or the consensus sequence (E409K) abolished GENE1 phosphorylation by GENE2.
These data indicate that GENE1 phosphorylates a single site (Ser411) in GENE2.
Sky1p Is Required for Efficient GENE1-GENE2 Interaction
The GENE1-PrA fusion protein from yeast cytoplasmic extracts was captured by IgG-Sepharose and associated GENE2 was detected by Western blotting using polyclonal anti-GENE2 antibodies.
GENE1 bound GENE2-PrA in wild-type yeast as previously reported (Pemberton et al. 1997; Senger et al. 1998), but binding was less efficient in sky1Delta cells (Fig. 3 a; see also Fig. 6 d).
These results demonstrate that Sky1p plays an important role in facilitating the interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 in vivo and provide a molecular basis for the observation that Sky1p-mediated phosphorylation is required for efficient nuclear localization of GENE1.
To determine whether Sky1p mediates a direct interaction between the cargo and its import receptor, we carried out in vitro binding studies using a GST-GENE1 fusion protein to pull down in vitro-translated 35S-labeled GENE2.
We found that phosphorylated GENE1 bound GENE2 directly (Fig. 3 b, lane 4) with a high affinity (Kd = 30 nM, data not shown).
Indeed, we observed that binding of unphosphorylated GST-GENE1 to GENE2 was significantly reduced in the presence of a yeast extract while binding of phosphorylated GST-GENE1 remained efficient (Fig. 3 b, lanes 6-9).
To provide further evidence that GENE1 interacts directly with GENE2, we expressed and purified recombinant histidine and S peptide-tagged GENE2, which was then used to interact with GST-GENE1 in different phosphorylation states.
As shown in Fig. 3 c, recombinant His-S-GENE1 bound GST-GENE2.
Together, these results demonstrate that the physical interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 is profoundly affected by Sky1p-mediated phosphorylation both in vivo and in vitro in the presence of a yeast extract.
Future studies will test whether other GENE1 cargos unaffected by Sky1p in the extracts compete out unphosphorylated GENE2, or more interestingly, whether a cofactor cooperates with GENE1 to enhance and/or stabilize its interaction with phosphorylated GENE2.
In the absence of yeast extract, both unphosphorylated GENE1 and the COOH-terminal deletion mutant Delta1 bound GENE2, but further deletion of the RGG domain gradually decreased binding (Fig. 4 a, lanes 2-7).
Significantly, our binding studies revealed that the interaction of GENE1 with the RGG domain of GENE2 decreased gradually as this domain was truncated (Fig. 4 a, lanes 2-7).
To provide further in vivo evidence for the functional importance of the interaction between the RGG box and GENE1 in nuclear import, we reasoned that if the absence of Sky1p-mediated phosphorylation impaired but did not eliminate the GENE2-GENE1 interaction as seen in the coimmunoprecipitation and in vitro binding experiments, overexpression of GENE1 might compensate for both inefficient GENE1 binding and nuclear import caused by phosphorylation defects.
Arginine Methylation Indirectly Interferes with the GENE1-GENE2 Interaction
To understand the mechanism by which arginine methylation interferes with the GENE1-OTHER_GENE interaction in vivo, we asked whether the reduced interaction between GENE1 and OTHER_GENE was a direct consequence of GENE2-catalyzed arginine methylation of the RGG motifs in GENE1.

To understand the mechanism by which arginine methylation interferes with the OTHER_GENE-GENE1 interaction in vivo, we asked whether the reduced interaction between OTHER_GENE and GENE1 was a direct consequence of GENE2-catalyzed arginine methylation of the RGG motifs in OTHER_GENE.
As shown in Fig. 7 b, both unmethylated control and GENE1 treated with saturating methylation conditions bound GENE2 indistinguishably (lanes 3 and 4), suggesting that methylation alone does not affect the GENE1-GENE2 interaction.
We noted, however, that the interaction of GENE1 with GENE2 was significantly reduced in the presence of yeast extract, regardless of its methylation state (Fig. 7 b, lanes 6 and 7), indicating that phosphorylation might be a prerequisite for a potential methylation effect on GENE1 binding to GENE2.
These results suggest that Hmt1p/Rmt1p-mediated methylation may interfere with the GENE1-GENE2 interaction through an indirect mechanism.
Thus, newly synthesized OTHER_GENE may be readily phosphorylated by GENE1 in the cytoplasm for efficient interaction with its nuclear import receptor GENE2, which leads to efficient nuclear import, and this modification may also be important for the function of OTHER_GENE in the nucleus.

(c) Effect of double modification on GENE1 binding to GENE2.
These studies support a critical role for GENE1 in GENE2 action in which estrogen stimulates an GENE2-GENE1 association coupling GENE1 to regions of chromatin at the sites of estrogen-responsive promotGENE2s and promotes the activity of othGENE2 recruited factors that altGENE2 the acetylation state of chromatin.
We find that in response to estrogen, GENE1 recruits GENE2, thGENE1eby targeting GENE2 to the promotGENE1s of estrogen-responsive genes in a mannGENE1 that occurs simultaneous to histone acetylation.
We find that estrogen stimulates an association between GENE1 and GENE2 that is consistent with transcriptional activation.
Likewise, immunoprecipitation of GENE1 from similarly retained fractions indicated that GENE1 was capable of associating with the HBD of GENE2 in a response to hormone (Fig. 2b).
Consistent with previous studies, it was obsGENE1ved that GENE2 was capable of intGENE1acting with the complete HBD of GENE1 in response to 17beta-estradiol (Fig. 2a).
In this papGENE1 we report an association between GENE1 and GENE2 that we believe is mediated by additional factors.
Our data suggest that upon hormone binding, the GENE1 associates with GENE2, thGENE1eby recruiting GENE2 to the sites of estrogen-responsive chromatin.

One clone, termed clone A2, interacted with both GENE1 and GENE2 (Fig. 1).
Association of GENE1 with GENE2.
In a cosedimentation assay, GENE1(233-674) bound equally well to both thiophosphorylated (active) and unphosphorylated (inactive) forms of human GENE2 (Fig. 2B).
This demonstrated that GENE1 directly bound GENE2 and the conformation change that results from GENE2 phosphorylation by PKA to produce a potent PP1 inhibitor does not influence GENE2's association with GENE1.
Mapping GENE1 binding to GENE2.
As anticipated from the above experiments, GENE1(233-674) bound equally well to both thiophosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of full-length His-tagged GENE2 (Fig. 3B).
Indeed, following their phosphorylation by PKA, all the immobilized GENE1 peptides bound GENE2 (Fig. 3C).
This provided support for an GENE1/OTHER_GENE complex in mammalian cells and also suggested that GENE1 binding was not sensitive to potential cellular modifications that may have prevented GENE2 binding to full-length OTHER_GENE in HEK293T cells.

This provided support for an OTHER_GENE/GENE1 complex in mammalian cells and also suggested that OTHER_GENE binding was not sensitive to potential cellular modifications that may have prevented GENE2 binding to full-length GENE1 in HEK293T cells.
The relative concentration of full-length GENE1 by the GENE2 beads compared to other GENE1 peptides suggested that WT GENE1 possessed a higher affinity for GENE2 than the shorter GENE1 peptides that lacked the highly basic N-terminal 180 amino acids.
Immunoblotting the GENE1-bound proteins with an anti-FLAG antibody established that all GENE2 polypeptides, including the full-length protein, were concentrated by the GENE1 beads (Fig. 4D).

Our in vitro studies suggested that GENE1 bound to GENE2, encoded by a human brain cDNA, functions as an eIF-2alpha phosphatase.
Western blotting showed that GENE1 was associated with GENE2 in active brain samples, but despite greatly elevated levels of GENE1 in the hibernating brain samples, no detectable GENE1 association with GENE2 was observed.
To analyze the GENE1/GENE2 complex in active versus hibernating brain samples, we used affinity isolation of GENE2 complexes from equivalent amounts of brain extracts using microcystin-LR-Sepharose.
The finding that GENE1 forms a stable association, at least in vitro, with the growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein GENE2 provided the first evidence for a novel function of the GENE1 C terminus, namely, to recruit cellular proteins that modulate the PP1 catalytic subunit.
Analysis of GENE1/OTHER_GENE and GENE2/OTHER_GENE interactions showed that both GENE2 and GENE1 bound OTHER_GENE in brain tissue from active animals, which demonstrated low steady-state phosphorylation of eIF-2alpha.

GENE1 preferentially interacts with unphosphorylated GENE2 in a complex where both GENE2 kinase activity and GENE1 acetylase activity are inhibited.

Here we show that GENE1 and GENE2 associate in a complex in quiescent cells and that they dissociate within a few minutes upon mitogenic stimulus.
Mitogen-regulated association of GENE1 and GENE2.
Interestingly, association of GENE1 with GENE2 was detected when cells remained in a quiescent state, i.e., in a medium deprived of serum.
In both cases, GENE1 and GENE2 were readily coprecipitated (Fig. 1A).
We tested whether stimulation by EGF could modulate the GENE1-GENE2 interaction.
This indicated that dissociation of the GENE1-GENE2 complex could be phosphorylation dependent.
In conclusion, association of GENE1 with GENE2 correlates inversely with GENE1 phosphorylation.
Dissociation of GENE1 from GENE2 was maximal 10 to 30 min after stimulation, concomitant with a drastic increase in GENE1 phosphorylation.
GENE1 was present in anti-GENE2 immunoprecipitates prepared from NIH 3T3 (Fig. 1B, right panel), COS, and HEK 293 cells (not shown) following the same kinetics after EGF stimulation as in transfected cells.
Our results confirm and extend previous observations showing GENE1 interaction with p90rsk (38), and reveal that phosphorylation of GENE2 is a critical event regulating GENE2-GENE1 complex formation.
Phorbol esters and UV light regulate GENE1-GENE2 association.
Phosphorylation of GENE1 at Ser227 controls association with GENE2.
Thus, block of ERK signaling, which results in mostly dephosphorylated RSKs, elicits a stable GENE1-GENE2 complex.
In cells stimulated with EGF but concomitantly treated with the MEK1/2-specific inhibitor PD98059 (40), the GENE1-GENE2 dissociation is impaired (Fig. 3A).
Only the N-terminally truncated protein GENE1(1-350) bound GENE2.
The effect of PDK1 on Ser227 phosphorylation disrupts GENE1-GENE2 association, as it results in a threefold activation of GENE2 even in cells deprived of serum (Fig. 3A and data not shown).
These data indicated that dissociation of GENE1 from GENE2 did not require phosphorylation of Thr577, while phosphorylation at Ser227 is a prerequisite for dissociation of the complex.
Collectively, these data suggested that phosphorylation of Ser227 in the N-terminal kinase domain of GENE1 is necessary and sufficient to induce dissociation of the GENE1-GENE2 complex.
Our data show that GENE1 and GENE2 preferentially associate when GENE1 is inactive, suggesting that complex formation might constitute a mechanism to impair GENE1 kinase activity.
Thus, altogether, these results indicated that binding of GENE1 to GENE2 impaired its kinase activity.
Our findings support a model in which formation of the GENE1-GENE2 complex is phosphorylation dependent.

Physical Interaction Between GENE1) and GENE2.
GENE1) bound strongly to GENE2 (Fig. 1A), with an affinity similar to that of the interaction between transforming growth factor-beta type I receptor and FK506-binding protein, FKBP12, a high-affinity interaction that served as a positive control (26) (Fig. 1A).
In this affinity "pull-down" assay, GENE1 and the previously reported GENE2-binding protein mSin3A were retained on the GST-GENE2 beads but not the GST beads (Fig. 1B).
With immunoprecipitation analysis, we showed that the FLAG-tagged GENE1 could be efficiently coimmunoprecipitated with Myc-tagged GENE2) (Fig. 1C), thus demonstrating an GENE2)-GENE1 interaction in vivo.

Plx1 abolishes the GENE1-binding activity of GENE2.
To test this hypothesis, we prepared GENE1 phosphorylated by GENE2 in vitro, and mapped 12 definitive and more than 20 potential phosphorylation sites using mass spectrometry, which is described in detail elsewhere [25].

Direct, activating interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 after DNA damage
Thus, after DNA damage there is a direct interaction between GENE1 and GENE2, and these proteins act in concert to regulate cellular responses to DNA damage.
This activation occurred by a phosphorylation-independent mechanism involving direct binding of GENE1 to GENE2, which was confined to the nucleus where GENE2 is localized, and mutated GENE2 (R175H) bound but did not activate GENE1.
To test whether GENE1 was influenced by DNA damage caused by camptothecin treatment, GENE1 was immunoprecipitated from camptothecin-treated cells, and its activity was assessed by measuring the phosphorylation of recombinant GENE2, a well characterized substrate of GENE1 (15).
Immunoblots revealed that GENE1 coimmunoprecipitated with GENE2 from nuclear fractions prepared from cells treated with camptothecin (Fig. 2B).
Similarly, camptothecin treatment resulted in the coimmunoprecipitation of GENE1 with GENE2 (data not shown).
GENE1 transiently transfected into GENE1-null H1299 lung carcinoma cells (14) coimmunoprecipitated with GENE2, and expression of GENE1 was sufficient to increase the activity of nuclear GENE2 (Fig. 2C).
Thus, these experiments have shown that GENE1 is capable of directly binding to GENE2, and this direct association increases the activity of GENE2.
This identification of a direct, activating interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 reveals new mechanisms that regulate the actions of each of these proteins, provides a mechanistic explanation for several previously reported findings, and raises potentially new therapeutic strategies.

The GENE1-interacting region of GENE2 was further delineated by coimmunoprecipitation assays using Myc-tagged GENE2 mutants and FLAG-tagged GENE1 expressed in transfected cells (Fig. 2C).

In vitro translated GENE1 bound to the GENE2 activation domain but not its activation-deficient mutant protein (Fig. 1B).
To map the minimal domain of GENE1 that binds the GENE2 activation domain, a series of 35S-labeled deletion mutant proteins of GENE1 were incubated with the GST fusion of the GENE2 activation domain, and the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS/PAGE.
The GENE1 fragment of amino acids 352-625 bound most selectively to the GENE2 activation domain, and its affinity was as high as that of full-length GENE1 (Fig. 2A).

GENE1 Interacts with GENE2.
We observed that full-length GENE1 (HA-GENE1), but not the C-terminal truncation of GENE1 (HA-GENE1DeltaC) that lacks the cytosolic kinase domain that contains a potential GENE2-binding region (Fig. 2A), was able to pull down GST-GENE2 directly (Fig. 2C).
In addition, GENE1 only coimmunoprecipitated with the full-length GENE2, not with the C-terminal truncated form of GENE2.
When the full-length GENE1 was immunoprecipitated, we found that GENE2 was in the same immunocomplex with GENE1 but not in the complex precipitated by normal rabbit serum (Fig. 2D).
These in vivo coimmunoprecipitation data, together with the in vitro pull-down results of GENE1 binding to GENE2, suggest that GENE1 interacts with GENE2, probably with the kinase domain of GENE2.
Therefore GENE1 seems to be complexed with GENE2 in vivo, which requires the kinase domain of GENE2.
Using GFP-tagged GENE1 subunits expressed in HEK cells, we show that OTHER_GENE recruits the enzyme from the cytosol to the membrane by interaction with its GENE2 subunit.

Using GFP-tagged OTHER_GENE subunits expressed in HEK cells, we show that GENE1 recruits the enzyme from the cytosol to the membrane by interaction with its GENE2 subunit.
However, a small fraction of the YFP-fused GENE1 was also detected in the nucleus when coexpressed with wild-type GENE2 (Fig. 2 B, top).
Thus, fluorescent GENE1 subunits form heterodimers (see next section), present in the cytosol and nucleus of HEK cells, whereas distribution of the GENE2 subunit alone seems restricted to the cytosol.
Dimerization of GENE1 and GENE2. (A) HEK cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding NH2- or COOH-terminally YFP-tagged GENE1 and NH2- or COOH-terminally CFP-tagged GENE2 in different combinations.
To exclude the latter, we analyzed heterodimerization of different GENE1/GENE2 combinations by size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 3 B).
The elution profile of YFP-GENE1 (Fig. 3 B, bottom) was completely shifted to earlier fractions on coexpression with CFP-GENE2 (Fig. 3 B, top), indicating a high degree of heterodimerization.
A similar elution profile was found for GENE1-YFP + CFP-GENE2 (Fig. 3 B, middle), albeit a lower FRET efficiency was detected for this combination.
Hence, the different FRET efficiencies observed are not due to different degrees of dimerization, but likely reflect different distances of the fluorescent tags in the GENE1/GENE2 heterodimer.
Next, we examined the subcellular localization of GENE1/GENE2 heterodimers in the presence of free Gbetagamma.

GENE1 was detected by Western blotting of protein complexes precipitated from cells that expressed a V5-tagged, full-length GENE2 (V5-GENE21-232), an NH2-terminal truncated GENE2 (V5-GENE246-232), but not a membrane-truncated GENE2 lacking the extracellular domain (V5-GENE21-72; Fig. 5   A).
[35S]-GENE1 protein prepared by a transcription and translation-coupled, reticulocyte lysate system also bound to GENE2 in vitro, and a 40 amino acid region within the GENE1 extracellular domain (residues 109-149) appears important for GENE2 binding activity (Fig. 5 B).

We determined the equilibrium rate constant for GENE1 binding to GENE2 by surface plasmon resonance, a technique that measures real-time binding interactions by changes in the refractive index of a biospecific surface (41).
Optical biosensor surfaces, or protein "chips," were prepared and BIAcore analysis of the binding interaction between GENE1 (surface-bound GENE1) and sGENE273-232 revealed an equilibrium dissociation constant Kd of 9.0 x 10-9 M (Fig. 6)  .

In contrast, we found that modification of GENE1 by Alexa-488 under mild conditions produced a fully bioactive protein that enabled the expression cloning of GENE2 as a high-affinity, cell surface binding protein for GENE1.

For immunoprecipitation of GENE1 with GENE2, 293T cells (10-cm plates) were transiently transfected with 10 mug of expression vectors for Myc-tagged mutant GENE2, GENE1, or DeltaNGENE1 as indicated.
For immunoprecipitation of GENE1 with GENE2, nuclear lysates were generated from Y1 adrenocortical carcinoma cells.
Immunoprecipitations of GENE1 with GENE2 were done essentially as described previously (27).
However, DeltaNGENE1 was not immunoprecipitated by GENE2 (Fig. 1C), suggesting that GENE1 interacts with GENE2 via an interaction at the N terminus.
As expected, GENE1 was immunoprecipitated with GENE2 (Fig. 1C), similar to full-length TCF-4E (data not shown).
Unlike previously described TCF/LEF isoforms, GENE1 lacks a DNA binding domain; however, GENE1 retains its ability to interact with GENE2 (Fig. 1C).

GENE1 Interacts with GENE2 in Vitro.
GST pull-down assays with 35S-labeled GENE1 demonstrated a direct interaction between the GENE2 N-terminal bHLH/PAS domain and GENE1, but not between GENE2 and SRF under conditions where the known GENE1-SRF interaction was readily detectable (Fig. 2).
We hypothesized that GENE1 in smooth muscle cells might influence VSMC differentiation and the VSMC responses seen in vascular injury by direct interactions between GENE1 and either SRF itself or GENE2, the smooth muscle-specific transcriptional coactivator of SRF (25, 26).

After solubilization of mitochondria, a small amount of the GENE1, but neither Tim44p nor Kdh, interacted with tagged-GENE2.
Our cross-linking studies in which GENE1 binds to both processed and unprocessed GENE2 suggests that the TIM22 and TIM23 translocons are proximally associated in the inner membrane.
In addition, GENE1 and OTHER_GENE may be simultaneously interacting with GENE2p in transit; GENE1 might serve as a tether for the GENE2 substrate as it enters the intermembrane space, similar to a role for GENE2p in the import of PNPase (Rainey et al., 2006).

Two observations indicate that the catalytic domain of GENE1 (residues 102-300) primarily interacts with the Lsm domain of GENE2.
These results identify the Lsm domain as a region of GENE1 that directly binds the catalytic domain of GENE2.
Two observations indicate that GENE1 also interacts with the FDF domain of GENE2.
We also obtained evidence that the C-terminal domain of GENE1 binds directly to the catalytic domain of GENE2.
Specifically, we observed a two-hybrid interaction between these domains of GENE1 and GENE2 (unpublished data).
In addition, in binding experiments with purified recombinant proteins, GST-tagged GENE1 pulled down GENE2 (Fig. 3 F), and reciprocally GST-tagged GENE1 was pulled down by Flag-tagged GENE2 (not depicted).
In these experiments, the catalytic domain of GENE1 (residues 102-300) was sufficient to bind to GENE2 (Fig. 3 F).
In addition, the C-terminal domain, but not the N-terminal domain, of GENE1 was sufficient to bind to GENE2 (unpublished data).
These data indicate that the C-terminal domain of GENE1 directly interacts with the catalytic domain of GENE2.

In this work we have used live cell imaging to demonstrate the importance of key residues in the GENE1 GENE2 interface.
We have defined two GENE1 binding domains within GENE2 that allow the protein to both bind and bundle GENE1 without the need for dimerization.
We use both biochemical analysis and cell imaging to identify regions in GENE1 and within GENE2 that are important for their interaction.

The remaining mutant, GENE1-102, defined by mutations K359A and E361A, lies on the surface of the actin monomer in a region that is known to interact with a number of actin-binding proteins, and we, therefore, considered this as a likely binding sites for GENE2 on actin.

Mass spectrometry has permitted the identification of GENE1 as an interacting and regulatory protein of the GENE2 serine-threonine kinase activities.
The three members of the GENE1 family stably interact with GENE2, and the interaction was not affected by the bound nucleotide, GDP or GTP.
Thus, this GENE1 interaction with GENE2 proteins might regulate their kinase activity spatially and temporally in the cell, thus contributing to determining different roles depending on its subcellular localization and representing a functional compartmentalization.

As the amount of GENE1-His increased so did the amount bound to GST-GENE2 (Fig. 2E), indicating that this interaction is direct and does not require any additional protein.
Interaction of Endogenous GENE1 with GST-GENE2:

GENE1 phosphorylates GENE2.
To further confirm that GENE1 phosphorylates GENE2 directly, we assessed the ability of GENE1 to phosphorylate GENE2 using an in vitro kinase assay.
We found that immunopurified GENE1 was able to phosphorylate GENE2, and the kinase activity was greatly enhanced when GENE1 was purified from heat-stressed cells (Fig. 2B, lower panel, compare lanes 2 and 3), which correlated with the heat induced GENE1 activation (middle panel).
Cell lysates were precipitated with anti-Myc antibody and precipitates were analyzed by western blotting for the presence of Myc3-GENE1 and GENE2-HA3.
In wild type cells heat stress induced a transient interaction between GENE1 and GENE2, but in OTHER_GENE deletion cells the same treatment caused a prolonged interaction between GENE1 and GENE2.

In this paper, we demonstrate that human GENE1 proteins (Wu et al., 1999; Mah et al., 2000; Kleijnen et al., 2000) that are found in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm (Mah et al., 2000), and which are believed to function as ubiquitin-proteasome shuttle factors, interact with GENE2, an ER localized protein (Liang et al., 2006), in a novel complex that functions in ERAD.
In vitro interaction between GENE1 and GENE2
A yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen using the central domain of human GENE1-1 (UBQLN1DeltaUBLDeltaUBA; Fig. 1 A) netted four clones containing different portions of the N-terminal end of GENE2, an ER-localized protein that promotes ERAD (Liang et al., 2006).

The longest clone interacted 100-fold stronger with the same GENE1 bait than with the UBA domain of GENE1 or with unrelated baits, which indicates strong and specific interaction between GENE2 and the central domain of GENE1 (Fig. 1 B).

To confirm binding, and to map the GENE1-binding site in GENE2, we conducted GST pull-down experiments examining whether GST fusions of different regions of GENE2 bind radiolabeled GENE1 protein (Fig. 1 C).
Fusion proteins containing the central domain of GENE1 bound GENE2 efficiently, whereas those that lacked the domain failed to bind GENE2 (Fig. 1 C).
By additional pull-down experiments and systematic N- and C-terminal deletion of the GENE1 polypeptide, we mapped the GENE2-binding site to the N-terminal end of GENE1 (between amino acids 1 and 200; see Fig. S1), which is distinct from the p97/VCP-binding site located at the ubiquitin regulatory X (UBX) domain (amino acids 316-395) of the protein (Liang et al., 2006).
As shown in Fig. 1 (D and E), GENE1-His was efficiently pulled down by GST-GENE2 but not by GST-hHR23A or GST-His.
These data suggest that GENE1 binds selectively to GENE2 and not to all ubiquitin-proteasome shuttle factors.

Yet according to immunoprecipitation studies, we noticed differences in the amount of the proteins that were bound to OTHER_GENE under different conditions: the amount of GENE1 that was bound to OTHER_GENE was dependent on the amount of OTHER_GENE protein expressed, whereas GENE2 binding to OTHER_GENE was stimulated by either overexpression of GENE2 itself, by proteasome inhibition, or by enhancing ERAD.

For example, we found that GENE1 binds GENE2 with very high affinity (with a KD of 30 nm; Fig. S4).
Our in vitro binding results indicated that OTHER_GENE, but not GENE1, binds GENE2, which suggests that these two human ubiquitin-proteasome shuttle proteins cannot substitute for each other, at least for binding to the GENE2-containing ERAD complex.

Indeed, the N terminus of OTHER_GENE, containing its J domain (111-165) and the N-terminal extension upstream from the J domain (1-111; Fig. S3), binds directly to GENE1 and GENE2.
In contrast, the J domain of GENE1 directly binds to and activates the ATPase of the related Hsp70 GENE2 (Fig. S3; Meyer et al., 2007).
Individual fractions were analyzed for the presence of GENE1 mutants and the ribosomal protein GENE2 by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.
(E) Identification of GENE1 domain mediating association with GENE2. (top) Domain structure of GENE2 indicating position of the three zinc fingers (yellow) and the C-terminal Rpl24-binding domain (green) are indicated (Lebreton et al., 2006).
After immunoprecipitation for GENE1, the association with GENE2 was detected by immunoblotting with anti-Flag.
(bottom right) Yeast lysates were prepared from cells carrying an endogenously tagged GENE1 together with Flag-tagged GENE2 or GENE2 domain variants.
After immunoprecipitation for GENE1, the association with GENE2 was detected by immunoblotting with anti-Myc.
Because GENE1 is shown to associate with GENE2 through its zinc fingers (Meyer et al., 2010), we next examined the domains that mediate this interaction in both GENE1 (Fig. 4 E, left) and GENE2 (Fig. 4 E, right).
Cells expressing the indicated epitope-tagged GENE1 and GENE2 domain variants were subjected to immunoprecipitation against one of the proteins followed by immunoblotting against the other (Fig. 4 E).
As expected, the C terminus of GENE1 was indeed required for interaction with GENE2.
For GENE1, we find that the N terminus of GENE1, encompassing the first of the three zinc fingers of GENE1, mediates the interaction with GENE2 (Fig. 4 E, right).
GENE1 and GENE2 interact with nuclear ribosome biogenesis intermediates

Here, we report for the first time that the GENE1 and GENE2 form a constitutive heterodimer in the membrane, and their interaction remains unchanged in response to angiotensin stimulation at least during the time course examined in this study.
So what purpose does this constitutive interaction of GENE1 and GENE2, or any other 7TMR with an ion channel, serve?
We report that GENE1 interacts with GENE2 and fine-tunes the level of functional GENE2 at the cell surface.
Binding of histone GENE1 to the SUN family member GENE2 is chromatin independent.
We found that the budding yeast SUN protein GENE1 directly binds to the histone variant GENE2 but not other histones.
Biochemical and genetic data indicate that the interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 requires the GENE1 N-terminal acidic domain and unique sequences in the GENE2 N terminus and histone-fold domain.
Analysis of binding-defective mutants showed that the GENE1-GENE2 interaction is not essential for any previously described role for either protein in nuclear organization, and multiple lines of evidence suggest that GENE1-GENE2 binding occurs independently of GENE2 incorporation into chromatin.
Here, we examine the role of GENE1 binding to the conserved H2A variant GENE2 in chromosome positioning, gene regulation, genomic stability, and INM localization using genetic, biochemical, and cell biological methods.
Rather, our results suggest that GENE1-GENE2 binding is direct and specific, requires the GENE1 N terminus and unique sequences within both the GENE2 N-terminal tail domain and histone-fold region, and functions to target GENE1 to the INM during an unperturbed cell cycle.
GENE1 binds to the GENE2 acidic domain
We analyzed anti-HA pull-downs by immunoblotting using polyclonal anti-GENE1 antibodies and found that GENE1 and GENE2 coimmunoprecipitate (Fig. 1 D).
However, at 37 C, the entire N terminus of GENE1 is essential for GENE2 binding.
These results indicate that GENE1 primarily binds to the acidic region of GENE2, although other sites may be important for stabilizing the interaction at higher temperatures.

However, GENE1 was able to bind to the GENE2-M6 mutant protein as well as wild-type GENE2 (see Fig. 4 B).
We showed that these were not essential for the GENE1-GENE2 interaction, although reduced binding between GENE1 and GENE2 in cells lacking Chz1 may suggest a role for the chaperone in stabilizing the GENE1-GENE2 complex (Fig. 2 C).
To show that GENE1 and GENE2 directly interact in vitro in the absence of chromatin or other factors, we purified amino acids 1-150 of the GENE1 N terminus (wild type), a version of GENE1 lacking the acidic domain (Delta75-150; amino acids 1-75), and a version of the GENE1 N terminus that had 11 conserved acidic amino acids mutated to alanine (D11A: D88A, D89A, D90A, D91A, D92A, D93A, D104A, D110A, D113A, E114A, and D116A) as GST fusion proteins and incubated equal amounts of each, or GST alone, with purified HA-GENE2.
As shown in Fig. 2 E, the full-length GENE1 N terminus directly binds HA-GENE2, whereas GST, GST-GENE1Delta75-150, and GST-GENE1-D11A show little to no binding.

As shown in Fig. 2 E, the full-length OTHER_GENE N terminus directly binds HA-GENE1, whereas GST, GST-GENE2-150, and GST-OTHER_GENE-D11A show little to no binding.
Therefore, we conclude that GENE1 directly interacts with GENE2 and that the association does not require GENE2 assembly into chromatin.
Role of GENE1-GENE2 binding in transcriptional regulation and DNA damage repair
Our observation that GENE1 interacts with GENE2 outside of the context of chromatin leads to the prediction that loss of GENE1-GENE2 binding should not have any effect on transcriptional regulation or the maintenance of genomic integrity.
In the experiments that follow, we tested this hypothesis using multiple lines of investigation; in all cases, our results are consistent with a chromatin-independent function for GENE1-GENE2 binding.
We further confirmed that GENE1 is not involved in GENE2-mediated transcriptional regulation by showing that mutations of N-terminal lysine residues (K4, K8, K11, and K14) in GENE2, which undergo acetylation at promoters of active genes (Babiarz et al., 2006; Keogh et al., 2006; Millar et al., 2006; Halley et al., 2010), do not affect GENE1 binding (Fig. 3 C).
Analysis of GENE1-GENE2 binding in transcriptional regulation and after DNA damage.
Furthermore, the amount of GENE1 bound to GENE2 did not increase under conditions of DNA damage (Fig. 3, F and G), which we would expect if the GENE1-GENE2 association were controlled by being part of the cellular response to DNA damage.
GENE1 binds to two distinct and unique regions in GENE2. (A) Alignment of budding yeast GENE2 and H2A showing identical residues in black and unique residues in red.
GENE1 binds to the GENE2 N terminus
Using a series of deletion and point mutants, we mapped the region of GENE1 required for binding to GENE2 so that we might better understand the role that the GENE2-GENE1 interaction plays in vivo.
Collectively, these data indicate that GENE1 interacts with at least two distinct regions of GENE2: a region in the N terminus that has similarity to a basic NLS and a region in the histone-fold domain that is divergent between GENE2 and H2A.
The inability of specific GENE1 mutants to restore growth to GENE2-F592S is consistent with our data that these domains mediate the GENE2-GENE1 interaction and support the possibility that GENE2-GENE1 binding is important for INM localization of GENE2.

In this paper, we examine the interaction between the SUN protein GENE1 and the histone variant GENE2.
We initially anticipated that GENE1-GENE2 binding would play a direct role in the recruitment of particular regions of the genome to the NE.
The interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 is highly specific and was identified by several different methods: two-hybrid, genetic, and biochemical analysis.
In all three approaches, GENE1 was the only histone that specifically interacted with GENE2.
Consistent with our finding that GENE1-GENE2 binding is chromatin independent, we found that transcriptional regulation is unaffected in GENE1Delta75-150 mutants that abolish its association with GENE2.
When combined with our data showing that the presence of DNA damage or mutations in GENE1 that abolish recruitment of certain types of DSBs to the nuclear membrane does not affect GENE2-GENE1 binding, these data strongly suggest that the GENE2-GENE1 interaction is involved in a novel aspect of nuclear organization.
Our hypothesis that GENE1-GENE2 binding functions to target GENE1 to the INM stems from the following set of observations.
Several of the Mcm subunits are phosphorylated by GENE1, including GENE2 (11,13,16-26).
Here, we examined the effects of GENE1 phosphorylation of GENE2 on the activity and function of GENE2-7 in vitro and in vivo.
We mapped GENE1's target sites in S. cerevisiae GENE2 to serines 164 and 170 using in vitro kinase assays on N-terminal deletions and point mutations of GENE2 (Supplementary Figure S2A-D).

These and previous findings indicate that TRAPPII interacts with two different Arf1p GTPase-binding partners, the Arf1p activator GENE1 and the COPI effector coat complex GENE2 (Cai et al., 2005; Yamasaki et al., 2009).
In an effort to identify binding partners for the yeast GENE1 GEF GENE2, we performed two hybrid screens with its N-terminal and C-terminal regions.
These findings suggest that the TRAPPII-specific subunit GENE1 interacts with the C-terminus of OTHER_GENE, whereas the COG subunit GENE2 binds to the N-terminus of OTHER_GENE.

To confirm the interaction of GENE1 with the COG and TRAPPII complexes in yeast lysates, we fused the genomic copy of GENE2 to GST and purified GENE1-GST on glutathione agarose beads.
Subsequently, the beads were probed with antibodies directed against GENE1 (COG subunit) and GENE2 (TRAPPII subunit).
Consistent with the two-hybrid data, the TRAPPII-specific subunit GENE1 specifically bound to GST-GENE2 and not GST (Figure 2B; compare lane 2 with lanes 1 and 3).

Interestingly, when we fractionated a GENE1 lysate on a sieving column, most of the GENE2 in a GENE1 lysate eluted in fraction 9, which is where wild-type TRAPPII elutes (Figure 2D).
Approximately 5% of the total GENE1 (Figure 2E; compare lanes 2 and 4) in the binding reaction bound to GST-GENE2 (note that the asterisk marks a degradation product of GENE1) but not GST (lane1).
Approximately 5% of the total GENE1 (Figure 2E; compare lanes 2 and 4) in the binding reaction bound to GST-GENE2DeltaN (note that the asterisk marks a degradation product of GENE1) but not GST (lane1).
Together, these findings show that TRAPPII binds directly to the C-terminus of GENE1, an interaction that appears to be mediated by GENE2.
This interaction appears to be conserved in yeast, as we showed that OTHER_GENE-myc specifically binds to purified recombinant GST-GENE1 and not GST, GST-GENE2, or GST-OTHER_GENE (Supplemental Figure S3).

Here we showed that the TRAPPII-specific subunit GENE1 binds to the OTHER_GENE exchange factor GENE2.
Here we showed that the TRAPPII-specific subunit GENE1 binds to the GENE2 exchange factor OTHER_GENEp.
Here we showed that the TRAPPII-specific subunit OTHER_GENEp binds to the GENE1 exchange factor GENE2.
Two-hybrid and in vitro binding studies imply that the interaction of GENE1 with GENE2 is mediated by the C-terminus of GENE2.
Biochemical studies reveal that GENE1 physically interacts with internalized GENE2.
GENE1 is present in a complex containing GENE2 on endosomes and functions as a regulator of GENE2.

Notably, increasing amounts of GENE1-myc were cross-linked and coimmunopurified with GENE2-hemagglutinin (HA) upon longer incubations with cycloheximide, which induces GENE2 internalization (Figure 6A, 0- vs. 120-min time points).
GENE1 associates with an internalized plasma membrane protein, GENE2, and colocalizes with Vps5. (A) ESCRT-mutant (vps23Delta) cells coexpressing an integrated GENE1-13xmyc fusion and GENE2-3xHA (from its own promoter on a centromeric plasmid) were treated with cycloheximide for the indicated times and then cross-linked with DSP and DTBP.
First, GENE1-3xHA was specifically coimmunoprecipitated with GENE2-FLAG (Figure 7B).
GENE1 and GENE2 physically interact and colocalize on endosomal compartments.
Cross-linking of GENE1-13xmyc to GENE2-3xHA
Mgs1 appears to interfere with the function of GENE1 delta, consistent with our observation that Mgs1 inhibits the interaction between the GENE1 and GENE2.
We have now investigated the contributions of this domain to GENE1 activity in yeast and find that UBZ-mediated binding of the protein to ubiquitylated GENE2 specifically mediates the DNA damage-related functions of GENE1.
GENE1 preferentially interacts with polyubiquitylated GENE2 via the UBZ domain
GENE1 preferentially interacts with ubiquitylated GENE2 in a UBZ-dependent manner.
(C) Interactions of GENE1 were analysed in vitro as in B, but using GENE2 subjected to in vitro mono- (M) or polyubiquitylation (P) at K164 prior to the assay.
The interaction was enhanced by increasing the number of ubiquitin moieties to three or four, suggesting that GENE1 preferentially interacts with polyubiquitylated GENE2 (Figure 3A).
When assayed in isolation, HisGENE1 and the linear ubiquitin-GENE1 fusions all interacted efficiently with immobilized GENE2.

However, while HisGENE1 bound with comparable affinity to GENE2 and GENE2*, interaction of the ubiquitin-GENE1 fusions with GENE2* was strongly reduced (Figure 3B).
However, while HisGENE1 bound with comparable affinity to GSTGENE2 and GSTGENE2*, interaction of the ubiquitin-GENE1 fusions with GSTGENE2* was strongly reduced (Figure 3B).

Within an equimolar mixture of unmodified HisGENE1 and the ubiquitin-GENE1 fusions, a clear preference of GENE2 for the tri- and tetraubiquitin fusions was noted (Figure 3B, lane 3), confirming our two-hybrid data that implied a preferential interaction of OTHER_GENE with polyubiquitylated GENE1.

These data indicated that linear arrays of ubiquitin effectively mediate the UBZ-dependent enhancement of GENE1 binding to GENE2.
As expected, both GENE1 and GENE1* effectively interacted with unmodified GENE2, while the polyubiquitylated forms were enriched only by GENE1 and not by GENE1*, thus largely confirming our results with the linear ubiquitin-GENE2 fusions.
As expected, both GSTGENE1 and GSTGENE1* effectively interacted with unmodified GENE2, while the polyubiquitylated forms were enriched only by GSTGENE1 and not by GSTGENE1*, thus largely confirming our results with the linear ubiquitin-GENE2 fusions.
In order to determine whether the observed interaction of GENE1 with ubiquitylated GENE2 was relevant in vivo, we performed ChIP assays on synchronized cultures to follow the chromatin association of GENE2 and GENE1 at replication forks stalled by HU treatment.
The ubiquitin-mediated enhancement of the GENE1-GENE2 interaction in response to DNA damage or replication problems raised the question of what the function of GENE1 at replication forks is.
We therefore examined the effect of Mgs1 on the association between GENE1 and the polymerase delta subunits GENE2, which is known to make direct contacts with GENE1 (38).
As the GENE1-GENE2 interaction is detectable by two-hybrid analysis, we monitored the consequences of overexpressing MGS1 in this system (Figure 6).
Consistent with a competition between GENE1 and Mgs1 for GENE2 binding, overexpression of MGS1 or MGS1* slightly reduced the signal corresponding to the GENE1-GENE2 interaction.
GENE1 as an interactor of polyubiquitylated GENE2
Here we report a biophysical interaction between GENE1 and GENE2.
Our data shows a physical interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 protein exogenously expressed in 293T cells.
GENE1 physically interacts with GENE2
As shown in Figure 1B, by western blotting (WB) with an antibody against GFP, we detected Co-IP of GENE1 and Siva-2 in the presence of Myc/GENE2, but not in its absence.
Thus both GENE1 and Siva-2 specifically interact with GENE2.

In this report we have shown that GENE1 and GENE2 physically interact.
Two GENE1 isoforms have been identified and both GENE1 isoforms interact with GENE2.
Co-immunoprecipitation experiments verified previous observations that a deletion of the HR domain of GENE1 but not the NES abolishes interaction with GENE2 (Figure 5D) [20].
As expected, results of co-immunoprecipitation showed that GENE1-Delta103p interacts with GENE2, while GENE1-Delta140p does not (Figure 5D).
Intriguingly, both GENE1- and OTHER_GENE-GENE2 generated phosphorylation patterns with abruptly accumulating hyperphosphorylated species (Fig. 1a, b, d, e, Supplementary Fig. 1b).

Intriguingly, both OTHER_GENE- and GENE1-GENE2 generated phosphorylation patterns with abruptly accumulating hyperphosphorylated species (Fig. 1a, b, d, e, Supplementary Fig. 1b).
Approximately 3-4 molecules of GENE1 bound each molecule of GENE2, suggesting that several phosphorylated sites can bind GENE1 independently.
Approximately 3-4 molecules of GENE1 bound each molecule of pGENE2, suggesting that several phosphorylated sites can bind GENE1 independently.
An isothermal calorimetry binding assay of fully phosphorylated OTHER_GENE (GENE1) and GENE2 revealed a KD of 11 +- 2 muM, while the non-phosphorylated version showed no detectable binding (Supplementary Fig. 1d).

Using OTHER_GENE mutants carrying only one Cdk site (Fig. 2a, b), we found that GENE1-GENE2 rapidly phosphorylated just four sites (T5, T33, S76, and S80), and this specificity depended on the RXL2 and RXL3 docking sites in Sic1 (Fig. 2b; note that in all figure labels, the indicated Cdk sites are those left unmutated, unless otherwise indicated).

We incubated purified GENE1 (GST-GENE1), expressed in bacterial cells, with GENE2 extracted from yeast.
In the absence of GENE1, GENE2 phosphorylation was detected on both S2 and S5 (Fig. 2d).
To this end, we expressed and purified the human GENE1 homologue hGENE1A from bacterial cells and tested its phosphatase activity in vitro on human GENE2 purified from HEK293T cells.
To this end, we expressed and purified the human OTHER_GENE homologue GENE1 from bacterial cells and tested its phosphatase activity in vitro on human GENE2 purified from HEK293T cells.
Incubation of GENE1 with purified GENE2 led to dissapearance of S2 and S5 phosphorylation (Fig. 5c).
Together, our data are consistent with the idea that GENE1 and GENE2 form a stable heterodimer and that the critical role of the GENE1:GENE2 interaction is the physical tethering of GENE1 to the translocon via its interaction with GENE2.
The results of our studies provide no evidence for regulation of the activity of the GENE1:GENE2 heterodimer via modulation of the interface of the two proteins.
As expected (D'silva et al., 2008), GENE1 and GENE2 were efficiently coprecipitated from wt and GENE1Delta1-60 extracts but not from extracts derived from GENE2L97W mitochondria (Figure 4E).
Coprecipitation of GENE1:GENE2 was also greatly reduced in extracts from GENE1F99G/F104G mitochondria, indicating that these alterations in GENE1's arm affected the stability of the GENE1:GENE2 interaction.
Residues adjacent to the J-type domain of GENE1 are required for activity of GENE2:GENE1 heterodimer
The results of the experiments described earlier indicate that the stability of the GENE1:GENE2 heterodimer is critical for achieving a functional translocation machinery.
Therefore we decided to further investigate the GENE1:GENE2 interaction.
The synthetic genetic interactions of mutations affecting the region of GENE1 immediately N-terminal to the J-like domain with the L150W and L97W alterations of GENE2 and GENE1, respectively, raises the possibility that this region may play a role in the GENE1:GENE2 interaction.
GENE1 Interacts with and Ubiquitinates GENE2-LC1 in Mitochondria.
Immunoprecipitation assays indicated that GENE1-myc interacted with FLAG-GENE2 in SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 1B).
Similarly, endogenous GENE1 was found to be coimmunoprecipitated with anti-GENE2 Ab (Fig. 1C).
Moreover, a GST pull-down assay demonstrated that endogenous GENE1 coprecipitated with GST-GENE2 but not with GST alone (Fig. 1D).
(D) Pull-down of endogenous GENE1 with GST-GENE2.
(C) Endogenous association of GENE1 with GENE2.
GENE1 interacts with and ubiquitinates mitochondrial GENE2.
(B) Association of GENE1 with GENE2 in cell expression system.
To identify the sites of interaction between GENE1 and GENE2, we examined whether a C terminus- (amino acids257-278) deleted GENE1 mutant (DeltaC GENE1) interacts with and ubiquitinate GENE2.
Thus, a specific interaction between the C-terminal domain of GENE1 and a 20-aa domain of GENE2 is critical for the recognition and ubiquitination of GENE2 by GENE1.
GENE1 was found to ubiquitinate endogenous GENE2 (Fig. S3A) and an in vitro ubiquitination assay suggested that GENE1 directly ubiquitinates GENE2 (Fig. S3B).
Unexpectedly, an immunoprecipitation assay revealed that the interactions of these GENE1 mutants with GENE2 were not altered (Fig. S4A), suggesting that increased ubiquitination of C257W is not because of an enhanced interaction of GENE2 with GENE1.
We examined the effects of S-nitrosylation on the interaction between GENE1 and GENE2.
We obtained similar data for the endogenous GENE1 client kinase GENE2 (Fig. 3A).
However, in agreement with our yeast data, interaction of GENE1, OTHER_GENE, and v-OTHER_GENE with the artificial linker mutants GENE2-GSS63 and GENE2-GSS95 was indistinguishable from GENE2 wild type (Fig. 3 C and D).

As shown in Fig. 3A, immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag antibody detected GENE1 interaction with GENE2 wild type and with GENE2-Sc-CL, but GENE1 interaction with GENE2-Pf-CL was greatly reduced.

As expected, GENE1 coprecipitated with wt GENE2-S and not using GENE2-S(E112A,R141A) (Figure 5A).
Thus, GENE1-S(L114V) and GENE1-S(S89N) interacted normally with GENE2, which implies something in addition to GENE2 interaction is necessary for GENE1-S to cure [URE3].
GENE1-S(S89N) and GENE1-S(L114V) interact with GENE2. (A) His6-tagged wild-type GENE1-S or its mutants were adsorbed onto metal affinity resin and further incubated with yeast lysate from wild-type strain SY187.
As seen, GENE1 was detected from beads incubated with either wild-type GENE2-S, GENE2-S(L114V) or GENE2-S(S89N), but not as much from beads incubated with the GENE2-S(E112A,R141A).

The 3-M interactome data suggest that this could be facilitated by the direct interaction that we have identified with both GENE1 and GENE2, which are known to interact with the IGF2 5'UTR.
Here we show that GENE1 interacts and ubiquitinates epidermal growth factor receptor (GENE2) for proteasome-mediated degradation in pancreatic cancer cells, thereby inhibiting the activation of GENE2 downstream pathways.
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot demonstrated that endogenous GENE1 and GENE2 interact with each other in BxPC-3 cells (Figure 1Bi); the His-GENE1 and Flag-GENE2 that were both expressed after plasmid transfection in BxPC-3 cells can also interact with each other (Figure 1Bii).
These results indicate that GENE1 can associate with GENE2, recruit ubiquitin to its target protein, transfer GENE2 to the proteasome and induce its degradation in pancreatic cancer cells.
(B) GENE1 interacts with GENE2 in an endogenous or exogenous way.
(i)BxPC-3 cells were pretreated with MG132 (5 muM) for 6 h, and endogenous GENE1-GENE2 interaction was examined by immunoprecipitation with GENE1 or GENE2 antibody.
At the same time, the co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay was performed to test the binding site of GENE1 with GENE2.
His-GENE1 is precipitated following the Flag-GENE2FL protein, while His-GENE1 could not been pulled out by either of the two truncations (Figure 2Aiii).

These results were consistent with the GENE1-GENE2 interaction detected in the immunoprecipitation assay.
Our results confirmed that GENE1 could interact with GENE2 in pancreatic cancer cells.
Moreover, GENE1 interacted with GENE2 both in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation as well as in vitro through GST pull-down assays.
We further confirmed that GENE1 binds to GENE2 in vivo and in vitro.

Next, we further examined whether GENE1 directly interacts with GENE2 in vitro by GST pull-down assays.
As shown in Figure 3C, His-GENE1 recombinant protein bound to the full-length GST-GENE2 fusion protein but not to GST alone, suggesting that GENE1 and GENE2 could directly interact in vitro.

In this present report, we identified GENE1 as a novel GENE2 binding protein and demonstrated that GENE1 interacts with GENE2 in vivo and in vitro.
After viral infection, GENE1 interacted with tumor necrosis receptor-associated factor 3 (GENE2) and inhibited its ubiquitination by promoting the recruitment of OTUB1 to GENE2.
OTHER_GENE also interacted with Ikappa-B kinase epsilon (GENE1) after viral infection and impaired the association between GENE2 and GENE1, which further decreased the phosphorylation of GENE1 and interferon response factor 3 (IRF3), thus suppressed the dimerization and nuclear translocation of IRF3.

GENE1 interacts with GENE2 and suppresses GENE2 K63-linked ubiquitination
The results revealed that GENE1 interacted most potently with GENE2 (Figure S3A), and this association was confirmed under physiological condition in which the interaction was enhanced by SeV infection (Figure 2A).
Furthermore, the essential domain of GENE1 that binds with GENE2 was delineated by using a series of GENE1 truncation constructs, and the zinc finger and isoleucine zipper domains of GENE1 were found to be the crucial regions responsible for the association of GENE1 with GENE2 (Figure 2B).

(F) GENE1 suppresses GENE2 dimerization.
Taken together, GENE1 interacts with GENE2 and blocks the formation of the TRAF3-GENE2 complex, which subsequently impairs the phosphorylation of GENE2 and IRF3 and finally decreases IFN-beta production.
To achieve its negative regulatory function in cellular antiviral response, GENE1 associates with GENE2 and cooperates with OTUB1 to remove GENE2 poly-ubiquitin chain that is important for the recruitment of TBK1-IKKepsilon kinase complex.
Fas-associated factor (GENE1) is a novel GENE2 interactor that regulates GENE2-induced NF-kappaB activation via a negative feedback loop
Fas-Associated Factor 1(GENE1) was isolated from a HeLa cDNA library using the GENE2 cytoplasmic tail (216-278 aa) as a bait construct.
GENE1 was able to interact with GENE2 both in vitro and in vivo.
The GENE1 N-terminal domain was sufficient to bind GENE2 and required the TRAF6-binding domain within the cytoplasmic tail of GENE2 for binding.
Knockdown of GENE1 prolonged GENE2-induced NFkappaB, whereas overexpression of GENE1 suppressed GENE2-induced NFkappaB activity and this required interaction of GENE1 with the GENE2 receptor via its FID domain.
Fas-Associated Factor 1 (GENE1) was isolated as a novel GENE2-interacting partner, and we report a novel function for GENE1 regulation of GENE2-induced NFkappaB.
Identification of GENE1 as a novel GENE2 interactor by YTH analysis
On sequencing, one clone was found to code a partial cDNA of GENE1 (50-602 aa) and the other six clones were partial cDNAs of the GENE2 molecule.
To verify this putative interaction between GENE1 and GENE2, EGY48 yeast cells harbouring the pEG202/LexA-GENE2 (bait) or pEG202/LexA construct were grown in Glu/CM-H liquid medium, and LexA-GENE2 fusion expression was then confirmed by immunoblotting analysis using a specific anti-LexA antibody (Figure 1a).
An interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 proteins was confirmed as yeast cells were able to grow and form single colonies on the selective Gal-Raff/CM-H,W,L but not on the Glu/CM-H,W.L (Figure 1b).
The inability of yeast cells harbouring either pEG202/LexA-GENE1 or the pJG4-5/GENE2-HA.tag alone or the empty vectors to grow on the selective Gal-Raff/CM-H,W,L medium further indicates the specificity of GENE1-GENE2 interaction in the two-hybrid system.

GENE1 interacts with the GENE2-binding domain of OTHER_GENE via its Fas-interacting domain
OTHER_GENE interacts with the GENE1-binding domain of GENE2 via its Fas-interacting domain
In addition, a GST-LMP1 fusion protein was used as a negative control as an LMP1 protein does not possess a TRAF6-binding domain; instead, TRAF6 is recruited to LMP1 indirectly via TRADD molecules in the LMP1-induced signalling complex.11 An overexpressed GENE1 protein from the pJG4-5/GENE1-HA.tag construct in yeast cells was specifically detected using an anti-HA specific antibody with GST-GENE2 and A mutant but not with the CD40mT6 or CD40AmT6 or the LMP1 control, indicating the requirement of the TRAF6-binding domain of CD40 for its interaction with GENE1 (Figure 2b).
Both full-length GENE1 and GENE1mt co-immunopreciptated specifically with GENE2, but not with the empty pcDNA3.1 vector control, indicating that the GENE1 N-terminal domain (1-305 aa) is sufficient for GENE2-GENE1 interaction (Figure 2e).
Both full-length OTHER_GENE and GENE1 co-immunopreciptated specifically with GENE2, but not with the empty pcDNA3.1 vector control, indicating that the OTHER_GENE N-terminal domain (1-305 aa) is sufficient for GENE2-OTHER_GENE interaction (Figure 2e).
Endogenous interaction of GENE1 with GENE2 in GENE2-expressing carcinoma cells was also demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation in EJ cells, confirming the physiological relevance of this interaction (Figure 3).
We next sought to investigate the functional significance of GENE1-GENE2 interaction.
However, as we have shown here that GENE1 interacts with GENE2 and that this interaction requires the TRAF6-binding domain of GENE2 and the N-terminal FID domain of GENE1, we postulated that GENE1 regulation of GENE2-induced NFkappaB activation may be via an alternative mechanism requiring this interaction, perhaps through competition with TRAF6 for occupancy of this binding site on the GENE2 receptor.
As expected, co-transfection with GENE1 and HA-GENE2 resulted in co-immunoprecipitation of GENE2 with GENE1 (Figure 7, lane 5).
However, the additional transfection of TRAF6 resulted in a significant reduction in GENE1 co-IP with GENE2 (Figure 7, lane 7).
Although the interaction between GENE1 and members of the TRAF family is well characterised, this is the first study to show an interaction between GENE1 and Fas-associated factor 1 (GENE2).
Here we report for the first time the finding that GENE1 is also a novel interactor with the GENE2 receptor.
We further demonstrate that the OTHER_GENE-GENE1 requires the TRAF6-binding domain in OTHER_GENE and the FID of GENE2, as OTHER_GENE mutants lacking the TRAF6-binding domain failed to bind to GENE2, although the N-terminal domain of GENE2 (GENE2mt; 1-305aa) was sufficient to bind to OTHER_GENE in the co-immunoprecipitation analysis.
We further demonstrate that the GENE1-GENE2interaction requires the TRAF6-binding domain in GENE1 and the FID of GENE2, as GENE1 mutants lacking the TRAF6-binding domain failed to bind to GENE2, although the N-terminal domain of GENE2 (GENE2mt; 1-305aa) was sufficient to bind to GENE1 in the co-immunoprecipitation analysis.

In support of this, HA-tagged GENE1 fusions, including the full-length GENE1 (GENE1wt) and its N-terminal domain (GENE1mt; 1-305 aa), were co-immunoprecipitated and detected with GENE2 in the in vitro co-immunoprecipitation experiments.

Here, we report the crystal structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae OTHER_GENE snRNP core, containing most of GENE1 and all four RRM domains of the GENE2 protein.
Here, we report the crystal structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae GENE1 snRNP core, containing most of GENE1 snRNA and all four RRM domains of the GENE2 protein.
To investigate the mechanism by which GENE1 chaperones recycling of GENE2 snRNA, we determined the 1.7 A-resolution crystal structure of the highly conserved central region of GENE2 RNA bound to 83% of the 444-residue GENE1 protein, including all four RRMs.
Structure of GENE1 snRNA bound to GENE2
Instead, in the GENE1-GENE2 structure, RRM3 undergoes an approximately 180  rotation and 20 Angstrom displacement relative to RRM2, allowing RRM2 contacts with GENE1 RNA that would not be possible in the protein only structure.
Since the GENE1-GENE2 complex is the first determined structure of an RNP containing more than two linked RRM domains (Supplementary Table 1), it is likely that other examples of an interlocked RNP topology will be found.
Mapping of the GENE1-A62G-suppressor mutations in both GENE1 (ref. 27) and GENE2 reveals a striking correspondence between the suppressor sites and protein-RNA contacts, indicating that suppression is due to destabilization of the GENE1-GENE2 complex (Fig. 5c,d).
The observed interactions of GENE1 nucleotides 39-44 with RRM3 of GENE2 and nucleotides 54-58 with RRM2 and oRRM4 are expected to be mutually exclusive with base pairing in the U2/GENE1 di-snRNA38.
The stable interaction of GENE1 with GENE2 snRNA is at odds with its function as a U4/GENE2 annealing chaperone, since it must relinquish GENE2 to U4 snRNA, just as U4 must subsequently relinquish GENE2 to U2 snRNA.
We have determined the first crystal structure of GENE1 snRNA bound to the GENE2 protein, containing seventy nucleotides of GENE1 RNA and all four RRM domains of GENE2.
The GENE1-GENE2 complex reveals a striking degree of structural co-evolution of protein and RNA.

Co-immunoprecipitation was used to analyze interaction between GENE1 and GENE2.
Interestingly, GENE1 interacted with GENE2 and catalyzed GENE2 ubiquitination, ultimately leading to GENE2 degradation.
Because GENE1 is an ubiquitin ligase that targets several oncoproteins for proteolysis and GENE2 is known to be subjected to ubiquitin modification by beta-TrCP [1,26], we sought to determine whether GENE1 binds to GENE2 and leads to its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.
To this end, the interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 was confirmed in HEK293 cells by reciprocal co-IP of HA-GENE2 and Flag-GENE1 (Figure  5A).

We mono-GENE1ated GENE2 with N-terminally TAMRA-labelled GENE1 using UbcH5C S22R mutant34 and followed deGENE1ation in gel assays (Supplementary Fig. 3C).
Whereas GENE1 release by GENE2 FL is completed in <1 min, GENE2 CD requires nearly 1 h for full dissociation (Fig. 3a), confirming that the DUSP-Ubl domain activates GENE2 by promoting GENE1 release.
Since the low activity observed for GENE1 CD suggests a slow product release relative to GENE1 FL, we directly measured the kinetics of GENE1-GENE2 dissociation.

In addition, there is another interaction between the CREB-binding domain of GENE1 and the amino terminus of GENE2.
Experiments described in this report have identified interaction between the carboxyl terminus of GENE1 and the E1A-binding domain of GENE2.
The results showed that two regions of GENE1 bound GENE2.
The CREB-binding region of GENE1 bound both OTHER_GENE and GENE2 (Fig. 1C, lanes 4, 5, 7, and 8) but did not bind Stat1tc, which lacks both the amino and carboxyl termini of OTHER_GENE (Fig. 1C, lanes 6 and 9).

The results showed that the CREB-binding domain of GENE1 could interact with both GENE2 and beta (Fig. 2A, lanes 1-4), confirming the results obtained with purified proteins (Fig. 1C).
The E1A-binding domain of GENE1 only interacted with GENE2 (Fig. 2B, lane 5), not Stat1beta (Fig. 2B, lane 2), further confirming that the 38 residues at the carboxyl end is required for GENE2 to interact with the E1A-binding domain.

GENE1BP7  and GENE2 form an abundant, heterodimeric complex  in the cytoplasm that appears to have a function different  from nuclear import of proteins with a classical NLS.

Identification of GENE1 as Copurifying with GENE2
The finding that GENE1 copurifies with GENE2 on  an IBB column can be explained in two ways.
As seen from Fig. 1 B, GENE1 was recovered in the bound fraction only when GENE2 was  added.
Thus, GENE1 binds to the IBB domain via GENE2 and is therefore an GENE2 binding protein.
Furthermore, the complex of GENE1 and GENE2 can be purified on an immobilized IBB domain from a HeLa cell extract in the same  way as from an egg extract (Fig. 1 C).
GENE1 Is a Novel GENE2-Binding Protein
The GENE1-GENE2 Interaction Appears  Unrelated to NLS-mediated Protein Import
The GENE1/GENE2 Complex Is Dissociated by RanGTP
The GENE1BP7/GENE2 heterodimer can be formed by  binding GENE2 from a Xenopus egg extract to z-tagged  GENE1BP7 (Fig. 2 B).
The GENE1/GENE2 heterodimer can be formed by  binding GENE2 from a Xenopus egg extract to z-tagged  GENE1 (Fig. 2 B).
First, OTHER_GENE is now recovered  in the GENE1-bound fraction, confirming GENE1 as a  GENE2-binding protein.
To show that RanGTP can also dissociate a preformed  GENE1/GENE2 complex, we performed the experiment  shown in Fig. 2 C.
GENE1 was expressed in E. coli and  bound to GENE2 that was immobilized on IgG Sepharose  via a z-tag.
When the elution was performed with  RanGTP, z-GENE1 remained matrix bound, however  GENE2 was dissociated from GENE1 and recovered in  the eluate (Fig. 2 C).
Thus, the GENE1/GENE2 complex does not form in the presence of RanGTP.

In Xenopus eggs or HeLa cells, GENE1 and GENE2  form an abundant, cytoplasmic heterodimer.
A weaker interaction was found also between GENE1 and GENE2  but so far not between other members of the protein superfamily.
Two bands are specifically recovered in the IBB-bound fraction, GENE1, and a copurifying 120-kD protein that is referred to here as GENE2.
Note, binding of GENE1 to the IBB domain  is via GENE2.
Again, two bands were recovered  specifically in the bound fraction: GENE1 and a 120-kD protein that cross-reacts with the anti-Xenopus GENE2 antibody.
In the IBB-bound fraction,  both GENE1 and GENE2 give a strong signal.

Note that GENE1 but  no GENE2 bound to GENE2BP7 in the absence of GENE2Q69L.
Note that GENE1 but  no OTHER_GENE bound to GENE2 in the absence of OTHER_GENEQ69L.
If however, the GENE1 mutant was added, GENE2 binding was abolished, and instead, GENE1 (Q69L) was recovered in the bound fraction.

This part of GENE1 interacts with GENE2 in the two-hybrid system (Fig. 6).
pDAD-VRP1DeltaSalDeltaKpn1-3, which fuses in-frame the first 70 with  the last 100 codons of GENE1, generates a shorter version of GENE1 that shows strong interaction with GENE2.
Finally, pDAD-VRP1DeltaSalDeltaKpn1-2 that has an out-of-frame  fusion coding for only the first 70 amino acids of GENE1  was found to code for a protein able to bind GENE2.
Therefore, the first 70 amino acids of GENE1 are sufficient for  GENE2-GENE1 interactions in the two-hybrid system.
GENE1 Is an GENE2-binding Protein Important for  Numerous GENE2-associated Processes
To confirm the genetic predictions and to understand the nature  of these interactions, we examined GENE1-1 phenotypes, in  addition to temperature sensitive growth, for suppression  by GENE2.
We found that GENE1 and GENE2 are able to bind each other.

To investigate further the potential association of GENE1  with GENE2, and to identify any other proteins that may  interact with the GENE1/GENE2 complex, a series of  cross-linking experiments was undertaken.
When cross-linker was added  and either GENE1 (lane 3) or GENE2 (lane 4) was immunoprecipitated, a number of other proteins were detected.
GENE1 cross-linked to a protein with identical mobility to  GENE2, and both GENE1 and GENE2 cross-linked to  three other proteins:p95, p70, and p50:based upon  their respective migrations on the SDS polyacrylamide gel.
A faint band corresponding to GENE1 was also present  in the GENE2 immunoprecipitates.
In the presence of  cross-linker (Fig. 2 B, lane 1), GENE1 coimmunoprecipitates with GENE2 and the three other proteins: p95, p70,  and p50.
In lane 3,  antibodies against GENE1 immunoprecipitated both  GENE1 and GENE2, along with the three other proteins  that coimmunoprecipitate with GENE2 (compare lanes 1  and 3).
GENE1 has been shown previously to be  stably associated with GENE2 (Horazdovsky et al., 1997),  and hence this interaction was deemed to be a suitable positive control for cross-linking.
Therefore, to test directly  the possibility that OTHER_GENE and GENE1 are interacting with  OTHER_GENE/GENE2, P100 membranes were cross-linked as before, and OTHER_GENE was immunoprecipitated from the resulting lysates.

GENE1 and GENE2 Colocalize on Sucrose Density Gradients
Furthermore, there is  clear colocalization between GENE1 and GENE2 in the  denser fractions (fractions 8 and 9).
The fractions in  which GENE1 and GENE2 colocalize (fractions 8 and 9) appear to be more dense than the fractions that contain  Kex2p, and could correspond to a population of coated  vesicles or tubules.
GENE1 and GENE2 are Present in Vesicle-enriched  Membrane Fractions
As most vesicles also have a characteristic size in  the range of 40-80 nm (Schekman and Orci, 1996), we  have investigated the size of the membranes on which  GENE1 and GENE2 are associated by gel filtration chromatography.
The bulk of GENE1  and GENE2 coeluted slightly later in fractions 66-72.
These  fractions also contained GENE1 (data not shown), indicating that OTHER_GENE and GENE2 are present on membranes  somewhat smaller than the membranes that contain the  bulk of Vps10p (i.e., Golgi and endosomal membranes).

We observed that GENE1 coeluted with GENE2 (Fig. 8),  suggesting that they remain associated.
Similarly, GENE1 coeluted with  GENE2, consistent with the data from the cross-linking experiments (Figs. 2 and 3 B).
Thus, GENE1 and GENE2 associate with each other in the cytoplasm in a complex that  is >106 D.

Only overexpression of GENE1 was able to  suppress the CPY sorting defect seen in cells carrying the  GENE2 allele.
Cross-linking of both a crude lysate and the P100 membrane fraction demonstrated a direct interaction between  GENE1 and GENE2, and also revealed the presence of  three other proteins in a complex with GENE1/GENE2.
These proteins were subsequently identified as OTHER_GENE,  GENE1, and GENE2, and are all peripheral membrane proteins that are found in both the cytoplasm and on P100  membranes (Table II).

When the  solubilized proteins were subjected to gel filtration to size  the individual components, it was observed that GENE1 remained associated with GENE2 in a complex with a predicted size of ~400-500 kD.
The data presented in this report are consistent with the  complex containing OTHER_GENE, OTHER_GENE, OTHER_GENE, GENE1, and  GENE2 acting in formation of vesicles for endosome-to-Golgi retrieval, but do not exclude the possibility that  other proteins also function in this pathway (e.g., Grd19p,  Mvp1p, Vps30p, and Vps1p).

The bulk  of GENE1 and GENE2 remain associated with each other and  form a complex with a predicted size of 400-500 kD.
GENE1 remains associated with GENE2 in an ~230-kD complex.
We here purified  an GENE1-interacting protein with a molecular mass of  ~220 kD (GENE2) to investigate the function of GENE1 at  cell-cell adhesions.
GENE1 was partially  colocalized with GENE2 and interacted with GENE2 in vivo  and in vitro.
In this study, we found that GENE1 accumulated at cell- cell contacts, and that GENE2 interacted with GENE1 both in  vivo and in vitro.
A protein with a molecular  mass of ~220 kD (GENE1) was detected in the glutathione  eluate from the GST-GENE2 (1130-1612 aa) affinity column,  but not from the GST or GST-CD44 affinity columns (Fig.  1 a), indicating that GENE1 specifically interacts with GENE2  (1130-1612 aa) directly or indirectly.
Interaction of GENE1 and GENE2 In Vivo
When GENE1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-GENE1 antibody from confluent MDCKII  cells, GENE2 was coimmunoprecipitated with GENE1 (Fig. 4 a).
Similarly, GENE1 was also coimmunoprecipitated  with GENE2 (Fig. 4 b) when GENE2 was immunoprecipitated  with anti-GENE2 antibody from confluent MDCKII cells.
Interaction of GENE1 and GENE2 In Vitro
We examined which domain of GENE1 interacts with GENE2  using in vitro-translated GENE1 such as GENE1 (1-669 aa), GENE1  (670-1213 aa), GENE1 (1210-2100 aa), and GENE1 (2097-2554  aa; Fig. 5 a).
Affinity beads coated with GST or GST-GENE1  (1130-1612 aa) were mixed with the in vitro-translated  GENE2 (1-669 aa), GENE2 (670-1213 aa), GENE2 (1210-2100 aa),  and GENE2 (2097-2554 aa), and the interacting proteins were  then coeluted with GST fusion proteins by adding glutathione.
As shown in Fig. 5 b, GENE1 (1210-2100 aa) bound  to GST-GENE2 (1130-1612 aa), but GENE1 (1-669 aa), GENE1  (670-1213 aa), and GENE1 (2097-2554 aa) did not.
MBP-GENE1  (1476-1918 aa) was detected in the eluates from the GST-GENE2 (1130-1612 aa) affinity beads, but only slightly in  those from the GST affinity beads (data not shown).
In addition, as shown in Fig. 6, MBP-GENE1 (1476-1918 aa)  bound to GST-GENE2 (1130-1612 aa) in a dose-dependent  manner, and this binding was saturable when the amounts  of MBP-GENE1 (1476-1918 aa) were increased (Fig. 6, a and  b).
The apparent Kd value for binding MBP-GENE1 (1476- 1918 aa) to GST-GENE2 (1130-1612 aa) was estimated to be  ~810 nM under the conditions used.
These results indicate  that mainly 1476-1918 aa of GENE1 is responsible for binding  GENE1 to GENE2.
Interaction of GENE1 and GENE2
We here identified GENE1 as an GENE2 (1130-1612 aa)-interacting protein.
The present results, however,  showed that the GENE1 (1130-1612 aa) containing the proline-rich region interacts with GENE2, which has neither an  SH3 nor a WW domain, and that the GENE1-interacting domain of GENE2 involves the cysteine and histidine domains  characteristic of Ubps.
Here we showed that GENE1 interacts with GENE2 in vitro  and in vivo.
