Binding of GENE1 to GENE2
GENE1 Binds GENE2
To assay potential interactions by the yeast two-hybrid assay , GENE1 was fused to the lexA DNA-binding domain ( pKR37 ) and GENE2 was fused to an acidic activation domain ( pPE81 ) .
Induction of beta-galactosidase was observed when the GENE1 and GENE2 fusions were coexpressed , but not when expressed alone ( Table IV ) .
The level of induction caused by interaction of OTHER_GENE and GENE1 was similar to that seen for interaction of GENE2 and GENE1 ( Gimeno et al. , 1996 ) .
The level of induction caused by interaction of GENE1 and GENE2 was similar to that seen for interaction of OTHER_GENE and GENE2 ( Gimeno et al. , 1996 ) .

We report here the identification of a calcium-binding protein , GENE1 , that interacts preferentially with presenilin 2 ( GENE2 ) .
Yeast two-hybrid liquid assays , affinity chromatography , and coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirm binding between GENE1 and GENE2 .
To gain a better understanding of GENE1 function , we used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins with which human GENE2 interacts .
When cotransformed with GENE1 , the PS2-loop B bait produced an 8.5-fold increase in beta-galactosidase activity over the lamin B negative control , while the corresponding region of GENE2 ( PS1-loop B ) produced only a 1.9-fold increase in activity ( Fig. 1 B ) .

Affinity chromatography and coimmunoprecipitation provide further evidence for binding between GENE1 and GENE2 .
The GENE1 Homology ( Eh ) Domain-Based Interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 Connects the Molecular Machinery of Endocytosis to That of Nucleocytosolic Transport
The interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 occurs in the cytoplasm , thus pointing to an unexpected site of action of GENE2 , and to a possible role of the Eps15-Hrb complex in regulating the stability of Rev.
The GENE1 homology ( EH ) domain is a protein-protein interaction module originally identified in the tyrosine kinase substrates GENE1 ( Fazioli et al. 1993 ) and GENE2 ( Wong et al. 1995 ; Coda et al. 1998 ) .
In particular , the EH network might be involved in the control of nucleocytoplasmic export , as suggested by the finding that three EH-containing proteins , OTHER_GENE , GENE1 , and GENE2 , interact with OTHER_GENE ( also called hRip or RAB , Human Gene Nomenclature Committee approved symbols are used in this paper ) , a cellular cofactor for the HIV-1 Rev protein ( Bogerd et al. 1995 ; Fritz et al. 1995 ) , and with the related protein Hrbl ( Salcini et al. 1997 ; Yamabhai et al. 1998 ) .

The EH-mediated Interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 Is Required in the Rev Export Pathway
Binding of GENE1 to the EH domains of GENE2 depends on the presence of four NPF (asparagine-proline-phenylalanine)-containing motifs in its COOH terminus ( Salcini et al. 1997 ) .
We have previously shown that the EH domains are necessary and sufficient for binding of GENE1 to GENE2 ( Salcini et al. 1997 ) .
Thus the EH-mediated interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 is required for their synergistic effect in the Rev export pathway .

To investigate whether binding of OTHER_GENE to GENE1 or GENE2 has any functional consequences on transcriptional activation , HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with the TGF-beta-responsive p3TP-Lux reporter , an internal lacZ control , the GENE2 coding sequence , and increasing amounts of OTHER_GENE expression vector ( Fig. 6A , left ) .

GENE1 bound to the kinase domain of GENE2 and inhibited its kinase activity in in vitro kinase assays .
Finally , activation of GENE1 by several biological stimuli correlated with the dissociation of endogenous FIP200-Pyk2 complex , which provided further support for inhibition of GENE1 by GENE2 in intact cells .
Together , these results suggest that GENE1 functions as an inhibitor of GENE2 via binding to its kinase domain .
Since the full-length GENE1 activated the Gal4 promoter for the reporter gene LacZ when used as a bait ( data not shown ) , we subcloned a cDNA fragment encoding the NH2-terminal and kinase domains of GENE1 ( GENE2 ) into the pAS2 bait vector .
Based on its interaction with both GENE1 and OTHER_GENE as well as its apparent molecular mass ( see below ) , we designated the full-length protein as GENE2 and the longest insert ( encoded by pGAD33 ) of the three clones as CT-FIP ( COOH-terminal GENE2 ) .
Based on its interaction with both GENE1 and GENE2 as well as its apparent molecular mass ( see below ) , we designated the full-length protein as OTHER_GENE and the longest insert ( encoded by pGAD33 ) of the three clones as CT-FIP ( COOH-terminal OTHER_GENE ) .

To determine if GENE1 could bind directly to GENE2 in vitro , a GST fusion protein containing CT-FIP ( GST-CT-FIP ) was prepared and tested for its binding to recombinant GENE2 expressed in mammalian cells .
To detect GENE1 association with GENE2 in intact cells , 293 T cells were cotransfected with pKH3-Pyk2 encoding HA-tagged GENE2 and expression vectors encoding Flag-tagged GENE1 , CT-FIP , and NH2-terminal GENE1 ( NT-FIP ; residues 1 - 641 ) , or the vector alone as a control .
Coimmunoprecipitation of the lysates showed that GENE1 was associated with CT-FIP and GENE2 , but not NT-FIP , in intact cells ( Fig. 1 C ) .
Consistent with the in vitro binding and transfection studies , association of endogenous GENE1 and GENE2 was also detected by coimmunoprecipitation ( Fig. 1 F ) .
Therefore , we also examined the possibility of GENE1 association with GENE2 by both in vitro binding and in vivo coimmunoprecipitation experiments .
Fig. 2 B shows that GENE1 was associated with both the full-length ( left lane ) and COOH-terminal fragment of GENE2 ( middle lane ) , but was absent in the immune complex from cells cotransfected with the control vector alone ( right lane ) .
To examine the GENE1 binding site on OTHER_GENE , we tested the potential interaction of GENE2 with several fragments of OTHER_GENE in the yeast two-hybrid system ( Table ) .

To examine the OTHER_GENE binding site on GENE1 , we tested the potential interaction of GENE2 with several fragments of GENE1 in the yeast two-hybrid system ( Table ) .
As expected , GENE1 interacted with GENE2 , which is encoded by pGAD33 , but not the pGAD vector alone .
In contrast , the fragment containing the kinase and COOH-terminal domains of GENE1 ( KCPyk2 ) exhibited a strong interaction with GENE2 , although it also induced a slight basal activation when cotransformed with the control vector .
In this report , we have identified a novel Pyk2-interacting protein , GENE1 , by using the NH2-terminal and kinase domain of GENE2 as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen .
Interestingly , GENE1 could also bind to GENE2 via its COOH-terminal region as shown by both in vitro binding and coimmunoprecipitation ( Fig. 2 ) .

In a complementary coimmunoprecipitation assay , GENE1 was more highly precipitated in the presence but not the absence of cotransfected GENE2 ( Fig. 2B ) .
Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitates using an anti-HA MAb showed that GENE1 was precipitated in the presence but not absence of cotransfected GENE2 ( Fig. 2A , compare lanes 4 and 6 ) .
GENE1 was also coprecipitated from 293 t cells cotransfected with OTHER_GENE , a nontransforming mutant of GENE2 ( Fig. 2A , lane 5 ) .

GENE1 Phosphorylates GENE2 at a Single Site in the COOH Terminus
As shown in Fig. 1 c , deletion of the most COOH-terminal sequence ( Delta1 ) or point mutations of the predicted phosphorylation site ( S411A ) or the consensus sequence ( E409 K ) abolished GENE1 phosphorylation by GENE2 .
These data indicate that GENE1 phosphorylates a single site ( Ser411 ) in GENE2 .
These results demonstrate that Sky1p plays an important role in facilitating the interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 in vivo and provide a molecular basis for the observation that Sky1p-mediated phosphorylation is required for efficient nuclear localization of GENE1 .
We found that phosphorylated GENE1 bound GENE2 directly ( Fig. 3 b , lane 4 ) with a high affinity ( Kd = 30 nM , data not shown ) .
To provide further evidence that GENE1 interacts directly with GENE2 , we expressed and purified recombinant histidine and S peptide-tagged GENE2 , which was then used to interact with GST-Npl3p in different phosphorylation states .
Together , these results demonstrate that the physical interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 is profoundly affected by Sky1p-mediated phosphorylation both in vivo and in vitro in the presence of a yeast extract .
Future studies will test whether other GENE1 cargos unaffected by Sky1p in the extracts compete out unphosphorylated GENE2 , or more interestingly , whether a cofactor cooperates with GENE1 to enhance and/or stabilize its interaction with phosphorylated GENE2 .
In the absence of yeast extract , both unphosphorylated GENE1 and the COOH-terminal deletion mutant Delta1 bound GENE2 , but further deletion of the RGG domain gradually decreased binding ( Fig. 4 a , lanes 2 - 7 ) .
Significantly , our binding studies revealed that the interaction of GENE1 with the RGG domain of GENE2 decreased gradually as this domain was truncated ( Fig. 4 a , lanes 2 - 7 ) .
To understand the mechanism by which arginine methylation interferes with the Npl3p-Mtr10p interaction in vivo , we asked whether the reduced interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 was a direct consequence of Hmt1p/Rmt1p-catalyzed arginine methylation of the RGG motifs in GENE1 .
As shown in Fig. 7 b , both unmethylated control and GENE1 treated with saturating methylation conditions bound GENE2 indistinguishably ( lanes 3 and 4 ) , suggesting that methylation alone does not affect the Npl3p-Mtr10p interaction .
We noted , however , that the interaction of GENE1 with GENE2 was significantly reduced in the presence of yeast extract , regardless of its methylation state ( Fig. 7 b , lanes 6 and 7 ) , indicating that phosphorylation might be a prerequisite for a potential methylation effect on GENE1 binding to GENE2 .
Thus , newly synthesized OTHER_GENE may be readily phosphorylated by GENE1 in the cytoplasm for efficient interaction with its nuclear import receptor GENE2 , which leads to efficient nuclear import , and this modification may also be important for the function of OTHER_GENE in the nucleus .

These studies support a critical role for GENE1 in GENE2 action in which estrogen stimulates an ER-BRG-1 association coupling GENE1 to regions of chromatin at the sites of estrogen-responsive promoters and promotes the activity of other recruited factors that alter the acetylation state of chromatin .
We find that in response to estrogen , GENE1 recruits GENE2 , thereby targeting GENE2 to the promoters of estrogen-responsive genes in a manner that occurs simultaneous to histone acetylation .
We find that estrogen stimulates an association between GENE1 and GENE2 that is consistent with transcriptional activation .
Likewise , immunoprecipitation of GENE1 from similarly retained fractions indicated that GENE1 was capable of associating with the HBD of GENE2 in a response to hormone ( Fig. 2b ) .
Consistent with previous studies , it was observed that GENE1 was capable of interacting with the complete HBD of GENE2 in response to 17beta-estradiol ( Fig. 2a ) .
In this paper we report an association between GENE1 and GENE2 that we believe is mediated by additional factors .

Immunoblotting the I-1-bound proteins with an anti-FLAG antibody established that all GENE1 polypeptides , including the full-length protein , were concentrated by the GENE2 beads ( Fig. 4D ) .

Thus , after DNA damage there is a direct interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 , and these proteins act in concert to regulate cellular responses to DNA damage .
This activation occurred by a phosphorylation-independent mechanism involving direct binding of GENE1 to GENE2 , which was confined to the nucleus where GENE2 is localized , and mutated GENE2 ( R175H ) bound but did not activate GENE1 .
To test whether GENE1 was influenced by DNA damage caused by camptothecin treatment , GENE1 was immunoprecipitated from camptothecin-treated cells , and its activity was assessed by measuring the phosphorylation of recombinant GENE2 , a well characterized substrate of GENE1 ( 15 ) .

In vitro translated GENE1 bound to the GENE2 activation domain but not its activation-deficient mutant protein ( Fig. 1B ) .
To map the minimal domain of GENE1 that binds the GENE2 activation domain , a series of 35S-labeled deletion mutant proteins of GENE1 were incubated with the GST fusion of the GENE2 activation domain , and the bound proteins were analyzed by SDS/PAGE .
The GENE1 fragment of amino acids 352 - 625 bound most selectively to the GENE2 activation domain , and its affinity was as high as that of full-length GENE1 ( Fig. 2A ) .
To support this model independently , we constructed deletion and point mutant proteins of GENE1 - 145 and examined their ability to bind GENE2 in vitro ( Fig. 6A ) .
( B ) In vitro translated GENE1 binds the GENE2 activation domain but not its activation-deficient mutant .

We report that Kap beta2B ( transportin-2 ) forms complexes with the mRNA export factor GENE1 in the presence of GENE2 , as shown by coimmunoprecipitation from HeLa cells .
Kap beta2B Is Associated with GENE1 in the Presence of GENE2 .
GENE1 was present in the immunoprecipitated material , and the interaction strictly depended on the presence of GENE2 , as expected for complexes between nucleocytoplasmic export factors and their cargoes ( Fig. 1 ) .
The apparently minor differences in the primary structure produce dramatic differences in the interaction of the two Kaps with GENE1 and the cargoes ; whereas GENE1 dissociates GENE2 from Kap beta2A ( 30 ) , Kap beta2B binds GENE2 only in the presence of GENE1 ( Figs. 1 and 3 ) .
Kap beta2B and GENE1 form complexes in the presence of GENE2 .
GENE1 Interacts with GENE2 .
In addition , GENE1 only coimmunoprecipitated with the full-length GENE2 , not with the C-terminal truncated form of GENE2 .
When the full-length GENE1 was immunoprecipitated , we found that GENE2 was in the same immunocomplex with GENE1 but not in the complex precipitated by normal rabbit serum ( Fig. 2D ) .
These in vivo coimmunoprecipitation data , together with the in vitro pull-down results of GENE1 binding to GENE2 , suggest that GENE1 interacts with GENE2 , probably with the kinase domain of GENE2 .
Therefore GENE1 seems to be complexed with GENE2 in vivo , which requires the kinase domain of GENE2 .
Using GFP-tagged GENE1 subunits expressed in HEK cells , we show that GENE2 recruits the enzyme from the cytosol to the membrane by interaction with its OTHER_GENE subunit .
Using GFP-tagged GENE1 subunits expressed in HEK cells , we show that OTHER_GENE recruits the enzyme from the cytosol to the membrane by interaction with its GENE2 subunit .
Using GFP-tagged OTHER_GENE subunits expressed in HEK cells , we show that GENE1 recruits the enzyme from the cytosol to the membrane by interaction with its GENE2 subunit .
However , a small fraction of the YFP-fused GENE1 was also detected in the nucleus when coexpressed with wild-type GENE2 ( Fig. 2 B , top ) .
Thus , fluorescent GENE1 subunits form heterodimers ( see next section ) , present in the cytosol and nucleus of HEK cells , whereas distribution of the GENE2 subunit alone seems restricted to the cytosol .
Dimerization of GENE1 and GENE2 . ( A ) HEK cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding NH2- or COOH-terminally YFP-tagged GENE1 and NH2- or COOH-terminally CFP-tagged GENE2 in different combinations .

GENE1 was detected by Western blotting of protein complexes precipitated from cells that expressed a V5-tagged , full-length GENE2 ( V5-CD741 - 232 ) , an NH2-terminal truncated GENE2 ( V5-CD7446 - 232 ) , but not a membrane-truncated GENE2 lacking the extracellular domain ( V5-CD741 - 72 ; Fig. 5    A ) .
[35S]-CD74 protein prepared by a transcription and translation-coupled , reticulocyte lysate system also bound to GENE1 in vitro , and a 40 amino acid region within the GENE2 extracellular domain ( residues 109 - 149 ) appears important for GENE1 binding activity ( Fig. 5 B ) .

Real-time Binding Analysis of GENE1 to GENE2 ( BIAcore Analysis ) .
We determined the equilibrium rate constant for GENE1 binding to GENE2 by surface plasmon resonance , a technique that measures real-time binding interactions by changes in the refractive index of a biospecific surface ( 41 ) .
Optical biosensor surfaces , or protein " chips , " were prepared and BIAcore analysis of the binding interaction between GENE1 ( surface-bound GENE1 ) and GENE2 - 232 revealed an equilibrium dissociation constant Kd of 9.0 x 10 - 9 M ( Fig. 6 ) . Complementary binding analysis using GENE1 in the mobile phase and surface bound GENE2 - 232 revealed a Kd of 2.3 x 10 - 10 M ( unpublished data ) .

To assess the functional significance of GENE1 binding to GENE2 , we examined the capacity of GENE1 to stimulate p44/p42 phosphorylation in macrophages obtained from mice genetically deficient in CD7434 .
In contrast , we found that modification of GENE1 by Alexa-488 under mild conditions produced a fully bioactive protein that enabled the expression cloning of GENE2 as a high-affinity , cell surface binding protein for GENE1 .

While GENE1 interacts with GENE2 and inhibits a TCF/LEF-responsive promoter , GENE1 also interacts with GENE2 to activate promoters that are not responsive to TCF/LEFs .
For immunoprecipitation of GENE1 with GENE2 , 293 T cells ( 10-cm plates ) were transiently transfected with 10 mug of expression vectors for Myc-tagged mutant GENE2 , GENE1 , or DeltaNTCF-4N as indicated .
For immunoprecipitation of GENE1 with GENE2 , nuclear lysates were generated from Y1 adrenocortical carcinoma cells .
Immunoprecipitations of GENE1 with GENE2 were done essentially as described previously ( 27 ) .
However , DeltaNTCF-4N was not immunoprecipitated by GENE1 ( Fig. 1C ) , suggesting that GENE2 interacts with GENE1 via an interaction at the N terminus .
As expected , GENE1 was immunoprecipitated with GENE2 ( Fig. 1C ) , similar to full-length TCF-4E ( data not shown ) .
Unlike previously described TCF/LEF isoforms , GENE1 lacks a DNA binding domain ; however , GENE1 retains its ability to interact with GENE2 ( Fig. 1C ) .

GENE1 Interacts with GENE2 in Vitro .
GST pull-down assays with 35S-labeled GENE1 demonstrated a direct interaction between the GENE2 N-terminal bHLH/PAS domain and GENE1 , but not between GENE2 and SRF under conditions where the known myocardin-SRF interaction was readily detectable ( Fig. 2 ) .
We hypothesized that GENE1 in smooth muscle cells might influence VSMC differentiation and the VSMC responses seen in vascular injury by direct interactions between GENE1 and either SRF itself or GENE2 , the smooth muscle-specific transcriptional coactivator of SRF ( 25 , 26 ) .

In this paper , we demonstrate that human GENE1 proteins ( Wu et al. , 1999 ; Mah et al. , 2000 ; Kleijnen et al. , 2000 ) that are found in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm ( Mah et al. , 2000 ) , and which are believed to function as ubiquitin-proteasome shuttle factors , interact with GENE2 , an ER localized protein ( Liang et al. , 2006 ) , in a novel complex that functions in ERAD .
In vitro interaction between GENE1 and GENE2
A yeast two-hybrid ( Y2H ) screen using the central domain of human GENE1 ( UBQLN1DeltaUBLDeltaUBA ; Fig. 1 A ) netted four clones containing different portions of the N-terminal end of GENE2 , an ER-localized protein that promotes ERAD ( Liang et al. , 2006 ) .
The longest clone interacted 100-fold stronger with the same GENE1 bait than with the UBA domain of GENE1 or with unrelated baits , which indicates strong and specific interaction between GENE2 and the central domain of GENE1 ( Fig. 1 B ) .

( F ) GST pull-down assays showing that GENE1 , OTHER_GENE , and GENE2 bind together in a trimeric complex .
To confirm binding , and to map the erasin-binding site in GENE1 , we conducted GST pull-down experiments examining whether GST fusions of different regions of GENE1 bind radiolabeled GENE2 protein ( Fig. 1 C ) .
Fusion proteins containing the central domain of GENE1 bound GENE2 efficiently , whereas those that lacked the domain failed to bind GENE2 ( Fig. 1 C ) .
These data suggest that GENE1 binds selectively to GENE2 and not to all ubiquitin-proteasome shuttle factors .

Yet according to immunoprecipitation studies , we noticed differences in the amount of the proteins that were bound to GENE1 under different conditions : the amount of GENE2 that was bound to GENE1 was dependent on the amount of GENE1 protein expressed , whereas OTHER_GENE binding to GENE1 was stimulated by either overexpression of OTHER_GENE itself , by proteasome inhibition , or by enhancing ERAD .

On the basis of these results , we suggest that binding of OTHER_GENE to GENE1 is governed principally by the amount of GENE1 in cells , whereas binding of GENE2 to GENE1 is transitory , and might only occur during delivery of the polyubiquitinated substrate to the proteasome for degradation .

For example , we found that GENE1 binds GENE2 with very high affinity ( with a KD of 30 nm ; Fig. S4 ) .
Our in vitro binding results indicated that GENE1 , but not OTHER_GENE , binds GENE2 , which suggests that these two human ubiquitin-proteasome shuttle proteins can not substitute for each other , at least for binding to the erasin-containing ERAD complex .

GENE1 but not OTHER_GENE directly phosphorylates GENE2 in a S378-dependent manner in vitro

These results imply that while GENE1 does phosphorylate GENE2 protein in vitro , it is not dependent on S378 .
From the in vitro kinase experiments we conclude that both GENE1 and GENE2 phosphorylate Rad55-Rad57 in vitro .
To further assess GENE1 function , we conducted a two-hybrid screen using GENE2 as the bait .
This approach identified GENE1 as a protein that interacts with GENE2 .
Consistent with a recent study [ 34 ] , we concluded that GENE1 and GENE2 proteins interact in vivo ( Figure S2B and S2C ) .
Based on the physical interactions seen between GENE1 and OTHER_GENE , it has been suggested that GENE2 is a functional subunit of the Rtt101-based ubiquitin ligase [ 34 ] .

Both GENE1 and GENE2 associate with nuclear 60S ribosomal biogenesis intermediates and play an important role in nuclear rRNA processing , leading to mature 25S rRNA .
Indeed , the N terminus of OTHER_GENE , containing its J domain ( 111 - 165 ) and the N-terminal extension upstream from the J domain ( 1 - 111 ; Fig. S3 ) , binds directly to GENE1 and GENE2 .

Indeed , the N terminus of GENE1 , containing its J domain ( 111 - 165 ) and the N-terminal extension upstream from the J domain ( 1 - 111 ; Fig. S3 ) , binds directly to GENE2 and OTHER_GENE .
In contrast , the J domain of GENE1 directly binds to and activates the ATPase of the related Hsp70 GENE2 ( Fig. S3 ; Meyer et al. , 2007 ) .
Individual fractions were analyzed for the presence of GENE1 mutants and the ribosomal protein GENE2 by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting .
( E ) Identification of GENE1 domain mediating association with GENE2 . ( top ) Domain structure of GENE2 indicating position of the three zinc fingers ( yellow ) and the C-terminal Rpl24-binding domain ( green ) are indicated ( Lebreton et al. , 2006 ) .
After immunoprecipitation for GENE1 , the association with GENE2 was detected by immunoblotting with anti-Flag .
( bottom right ) Yeast lysates were prepared from cells carrying an endogenously tagged GENE1 together with Flag-tagged GENE2 or GENE2 domain variants .
After immunoprecipitation for GENE1 , the association with GENE2 was detected by immunoblotting with anti-Myc .
Because GENE1 is shown to associate with GENE2 through its zinc fingers ( Meyer et al. , 2010 ) , we next examined the domains that mediate this interaction in both GENE1 ( Fig. 4 E , left ) and GENE2 ( Fig. 4 E , right ) .
Cells expressing the indicated epitope-tagged GENE1 and GENE2 domain variants were subjected to immunoprecipitation against one of the proteins followed by immunoblotting against the other ( Fig. 4 E ) .
As expected , the C terminus of GENE1 was indeed required for interaction with GENE2 .
For GENE1 , we find that the N terminus of GENE1 , encompassing the first of the three zinc fingers of GENE1 , mediates the interaction with GENE2 ( Fig. 4 E , right ) .
GENE1 and GENE2 interact with nuclear ribosome biogenesis intermediates
Interestingly , the nuclear Jjj1-DeltaC interacted much more strongly than full-length GENE1 with the very early 60S biogenesis factors OTHER_GENE and GENE2 ( Fig. 6 A ) , perhaps because of the higher concentration of Jjj1-DeltaC in the nucleus .

Here , we show that GENE1 and GENE2 are in vitro targets of Clb2/Cdc28 and that the mutation of conserved CDK phosphorylation sites on GENE1 inhibits spindle pole separation without affecting the protein 's in vivo localization or abundance .
We next determined that Clb2/Cdc28 phosphorylates GENE1 and GENE2 in vitro , and also that Clb/Cdc28 complexes do not regulate either the abundance or localization of these kinesins-5 in vivo .

GENE1 and GENE2 Interact with Each Other and Form a Multiprotein Complex with beta-Arrestin 1
As shown in Fig. 1 , F and G , we detected a constitutive interaction between the GENE1 and GENE2 , and this interaction is not modulated by angiotensin stimulation during the time course examined in this experiment .
We also observed a similar pattern of constitutive interaction of GENE1 and GENE2 in HEK-293 cells ( supplemental Fig. S2 , A and B ) .
Taken together with the data presented in Fig. 1 , A-D , these findings establish the formation of a previously unsuspected multiprotein complex involving GENE1 , GENE2 , and beta-arrestin 1 in response to angiotensin stimulation .
What are the functional outcomes of this physical interaction among GENE1 , GENE2 , and beta-arrestin 1 ?
Consistent with a previous report ( 42 ) , we observed a constitutive interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 ( supplemental Fig. S5 ) .
The interaction of GENE1 and GENE2 was not altered by angiotensin stimulation .
To check whether beta-arrestin 1 acts as an adaptor for GENE1 , we examined the interaction between GENE2 and GENE1 in response to angiotensin stimulation .
As shown in Fig. 4 , C and D , angiotensin stimulation promoted a significant interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 .
Interestingly , this interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 was dependent on the presence of beta-arrestin 1 as siRNA-mediated knockdown of beta-arrestin 1 inhibits the angiotensin-induced increase in the interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 .
Thus , our data identify beta-arrestin 1 as a previously unknown adaptor linking GENE1 to the GENE2 and provide the first demonstration that beta-arrestins can act as E3 ligase adaptors for ion channels .
GENE1 is required for angiotensin-induced ubiquitination of GENE2 , and beta-arrestin 1 acts as an adaptor for GENE1 .
D , densitometry analysis of angiotensin-induced coimmunoprecipitation of GENE1 and GENE2 ( shown in panel C ) .
Here , we report for the first time that the GENE1 and GENE2 form a constitutive heterodimer in the membrane , and their interaction remains unchanged in response to angiotensin stimulation at least during the time course examined in this study .
So what purpose does this constitutive interaction of GENE1 and GENE2 , or any other 7TMR with an ion channel , serve ?
Binding of histone GENE1 to the SUN family member GENE2 is chromatin independent .
We found that the budding yeast SUN protein GENE1 directly binds to the histone variant GENE2 but not other histones .
Biochemical and genetic data indicate that the interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 requires the GENE1 N-terminal acidic domain and unique sequences in the GENE2 N terminus and histone-fold domain .
Here , we examine the role of GENE1 binding to the conserved H2A variant GENE2 in chromosome positioning , gene regulation , genomic stability , and INM localization using genetic , biochemical , and cell biological methods .
Rather , our results suggest that Mps3-H2A.Z binding is direct and specific , requires the GENE1 N terminus and unique sequences within both the GENE2 N-terminal tail domain and histone-fold region , and functions to target GENE1 to the INM during an unperturbed cell cycle .
GENE1 binds to the GENE2 acidic domain
We analyzed anti-HA pull-downs by immunoblotting using polyclonal anti-Mps3 antibodies and found that GENE1 and GENE2 coimmunoprecipitate ( Fig. 1 D ) .
However , at 37 C , the entire N terminus of GENE1 is essential for GENE2 binding .
These results indicate that GENE1 primarily binds to the acidic region of GENE2 , although other sites may be important for stabilizing the interaction at higher temperatures .

However , GENE1 was able to bind to the htz1-M6 mutant protein as well as wild-type GENE2 ( see Fig. 4 B ) .
We showed that these were not essential for the Mps3-Htz1 interaction , although reduced binding between GENE1 and GENE2 in cells lacking Chz1 may suggest a role for the chaperone in stabilizing the Mps3-Htz1 complex ( Fig. 2 C ) .
To show that GENE1 and GENE2 directly interact in vitro in the absence of chromatin or other factors , we purified amino acids 1 - 150 of the GENE1 N terminus ( wild type ) , a version of GENE1 lacking the acidic domain ( Delta75 - 150 ; amino acids 1 - 75 ) , and a version of the GENE1 N terminus that had 11 conserved acidic amino acids mutated to alanine ( D11A : D88A , D89A , D90A , D91A , D92A , D93A , D104A , D110A , D113A , E114A , and D116A ) as GST fusion proteins and incubated equal amounts of each , or GST alone , with purified HA-Htz1 .
Therefore , we conclude that GENE1 directly interacts with GENE2 and that the association does not require GENE2 assembly into chromatin .
Our observation that GENE1 interacts with GENE2 outside of the context of chromatin leads to the prediction that loss of Mps3-Htz1 binding should not have any effect on transcriptional regulation or the maintenance of genomic integrity .
We further confirmed that GENE1 is not involved in Htz1-mediated transcriptional regulation by showing that mutations of N-terminal lysine residues ( K4 , K8 , K11 , and K14 ) in GENE2 , which undergo acetylation at promoters of active genes ( Babiarz et al. , 2006 ; Keogh et al. , 2006 ; Millar et al. , 2006 ; Halley et al. , 2010 ) , do not affect GENE1 binding ( Fig. 3 C ) .
Furthermore , the amount of GENE1 bound to GENE2 did not increase under conditions of DNA damage ( Fig. 3 , F and G ) , which we would expect if the Mps3-Htz1 association were controlled by being part of the cellular response to DNA damage .
GENE1 binds to two distinct and unique regions in GENE2 . ( A ) Alignment of budding yeast GENE2 and H2A showing identical residues in black and unique residues in red .
GENE1 binds to the GENE2 N terminus
Using a series of deletion and point mutants , we mapped the region of GENE1 required for binding to GENE2 so that we might better understand the role that the Mps3-Htz1 interaction plays in vivo .
Collectively , these data indicate that GENE1 interacts with at least two distinct regions of GENE2 : a region in the N terminus that has similarity to a basic NLS and a region in the histone-fold domain that is divergent between GENE2 and H2A .
The inability of specific GENE1 mutants to restore growth to mps3-F592S is consistent with our data that these domains mediate the Mps3-Htz1 interaction and support the possibility that Mps3-Htz1 binding is important for INM localization of GENE2 .
The interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 is highly specific and was identified by several different methods : two-hybrid , genetic , and biochemical analysis .
In all three approaches , GENE1 was the only histone that specifically interacted with GENE2 .
Several of the Mcm subunits are phosphorylated by GENE1 , including GENE2 ( 11,13,16 - 26 ) .
Here , we examined the effects of GENE1 phosphorylation of GENE2 on the activity and function of GENE2 - 7 in vitro and in vivo .
We mapped GENE1 's target sites in S. cerevisiae GENE2 to serines 164 and 170 using in vitro kinase assays on N-terminal deletions and point mutations of GENE2 ( Supplementary Figure S2A-D ) .

Here , the apc5CA mutant background is used to study a previously uncharacterized functional antagonistic genetic interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 that is not detected in APC5 cells .
To examine whether Hda1 positively interacted with the APC , we expressed galactose driven HDA1 carrying a C-terminal HA tag ( GALproHDA1-HA ) at low levels in WT , GENE1 and GENE2 cells by using glucose as a carbon source ( Figure 1B ) .
This supports the idea that GENE1 and GENE2 can associate in vivo at specific promoters .
GENE1 and GENE2 did indeed co-immunoprecipitate while bound to the same promoters , as shown by sequential ChIP ( Figure 7 ) .
GENE1 physically interacts with induced GENE2 and catalyzes prodomain polyubiquitylation
Although GENE1 did not interact with WT GENE2 , we found that constitutively active Ssy5-L126S V129A E131A interacted efficiently with GENE1 , as scored by the robust growth on medium selective for expression of the two-hybrid interaction reporters ( Figure 3C ) .

Indeed , more OTHER_GENE coimmunoprecipitated with the PP2A A subunit GENE1 in extracts from GENE2 cells than from wild-type cells undergoing meiosis ( Fig. 7 I ) .
Through yeast-two hybrid screening , we found that an ubiquitin-like protein named protein linking integrin-associated protein to cytoskeleton 1(PLIC-1 or GENE1 1 ) interacted with the Toll/interleukin-1 receptor ( TIR ) domain of GENE2 .
An interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 was confirmed in co-immunoprecipitation ( Co-IP ) and GST-pull-down assays .
Coimmunoprecipitation ( Co-IP ) studies revealed that GENE1 coprecipitated with GENE2 , but not TLR3 .
A GST-pull down further showed that the ubiquitin associated ( Uba ) domain of GENE1 directly pulled down GENE2 .
GENE1 interacts with GENE2
Fig. 4A showed that transiently expressed GENE1 was able to precipitate co-expressed GENE2 , but not the negative control protein .
It was found that the Uba domain of GENE1 alone is necessary and sufficient to bind GENE2 ( Fig. 4B ) .
Interaction of GENE1 and GENE2 .
Moreover , we performed in vitro OTHER_GENE kinase assay and found the kinase activity of OTHER_GENE was reduced in IR-treated DKO cells ( Figure 1d ) , suggesting that GENE1 and GENE2 regulate DNA damage-induced OTHER_GENE activation .

Interestingly , although phenotypes observed in GENE1 KO mice and MEFs are less dramatically than those in GENE2 KO mice and MEFs , the E3 activity of GENE1 is much stronger than that of GENE2 in the in vitro ubiquitination assay ( Supplementary Figure 4a ) .
To examine whether OTHER_GENE and OTHER_GENE could directly ubiquitinate histones , we performed in vitro ubiquitination assays and found that both OTHER_GENE and OTHER_GENE function together with GENE1 to ubiquitinate GENE2 and OTHER_GENE in vitro ( Supplementary Figure 4a ) .

Interestingly , GENE1 ( MOF-related gene on chromosome 15 ) , a common subunit in both the MOF and Tip60 complexes 41 - 43 , could interact with ubiquitinated GENE2 ( Ub-H2B ) , but not non-ubiquitinated GENE2 ( Figure 6a and Supplementary Figure 5a ) .
Notably , the region between amino acids 202 and 262 of GENE1 contains triple alpha-helixes that are very similar to other known ubiquitin-binding motifs 44 , 45 , and this region alone could bind GENE2 ( Supplementary Figure 5b and c ) .
Peptide binding assays demonstrated that pure wild-type Mediator forms stable complexes with the tails of Histone GENE1 and GENE2 .
Synthetic biotinylated peptides representing the N-terminal tails of histones H2A , H2AZ , H2B , GENE1 and GENE2 ( sequences listed in Supplementary Table S1 ) were incubated with purified wild-type Mediator ( 42 ) .
The only peptides of this group to associate with Mediator , in a pull down assay , were the tails of Histone GENE1 and Histone GENE2 ( Figure 5A ) .
To assess whether acetylation of any of these lysines affected Mediator 's ability to interact with the Histone GENE1 or GENE2 tails we performed the Mediator pull down assay with Ac-(K5,8,12,16)-H4 and Ac-(K9,14)-H3 peptides .

Here we show that the TRAPPII-specific subunit GENE1 directly binds to the C-terminus of GENE2 , an Arf1p exchange factor that functions in intra-Golgi traffic ( Peyroche et al. , 1996 ) .
These and previous findings indicate that TRAPPII interacts with two different Arf1p GTPase-binding partners , the Arf1p activator GENE1 and the COPI effector coat complex GENE2 ( Cai et al. , 2005 ; Yamasaki et al. , 2009 ) .
In an effort to identify binding partners for the yeast GENE1 GEF GENE2 , we performed two hybrid screens with its N-terminal and C-terminal regions .
These findings suggest that the TRAPPII-specific subunit GENE1 interacts with the C-terminus of OTHER_GENE , whereas the COG subunit GENE2 binds to the N-terminus of OTHER_GENE .

Subsequently , the beads were probed with antibodies directed against GENE1 ( COG subunit ) and GENE2 ( TRAPPII subunit ) .

Interestingly , when we fractionated a GENE1 lysate on a sieving column , most of the GENE2 in a GENE1 lysate eluted in fraction 9 , which is where wild-type TRAPPII elutes ( Figure 2D ) .
Together , these findings show that TRAPPII binds directly to the C-terminus of GENE1 , an interaction that appears to be mediated by GENE2 .
TRAPPII binds to the GENE1 GEF GENE2 , and it also interacts with the GENE1 effector complex COPI .

Biochemical studies reveal that GENE1 physically interacts with internalized GENE2 .
GENE1 is present in a complex containing GENE2 on endosomes and functions as a regulator of GENE2 .

GENE1 associates with an internalized plasma membrane protein , GENE2 , and colocalizes with Vps5 . ( A ) ESCRT-mutant ( vps23Delta ) cells coexpressing an integrated GENE1 - 13xmyc fusion and GENE2 - 3xHA ( from its own promoter on a centromeric plasmid ) were treated with cycloheximide for the indicated times and then cross-linked with DSP and DTBP .
GENE1 and GENE2 physically interact and colocalize on endosomal compartments .
Cross-linking of GENE1 - 13xmyc to GENE2 - 3xHA
Mgs1 appears to interfere with the function of GENE1 delta , consistent with our observation that Mgs1 inhibits the interaction between the GENE1 and GENE2 .
We have now investigated the contributions of this domain to GENE1 activity in yeast and find that UBZ-mediated binding of the protein to ubiquitylated GENE2 specifically mediates the DNA damage-related functions of GENE1 .
GENE1 preferentially interacts with polyubiquitylated GENE2 via the UBZ domain
GENE1 preferentially interacts with ubiquitylated GENE2 in a UBZ-dependent manner .
( C ) Interactions of GENE1 were analysed in vitro as in B , but using GENE2 subjected to in vitro mono- ( M ) or polyubiquitylation ( P ) at K164 prior to the assay .
The interaction was enhanced by increasing the number of ubiquitin moieties to three or four , suggesting that GENE1 preferentially interacts with polyubiquitylated GENE2 ( Figure 3A ) .
When assayed in isolation , GENE1 and the linear ubiquitin-PCNA fusions all interacted efficiently with immobilized GENE2 .
However , while GENE1 bound with comparable affinity to GENE2 and GENE2 * , interaction of the ubiquitin-PCNA fusions with GENE2 * was strongly reduced ( Figure 3B ) .
Within an equimolar mixture of unmodified GENE1 and the ubiquitin-PCNA fusions , a clear preference of OTHER_GENE for the tri- and tetraubiquitin fusions was noted ( Figure 3B , lane 3 ) , confirming our two-hybrid data that implied a preferential interaction of GENE2 with polyubiquitylated OTHER_GENE .

These data indicated that linear arrays of ubiquitin effectively mediate the UBZ-dependent enhancement of GENE1 binding to GENE2 .
As expected , both GENE1 and GENE1 * effectively interacted with unmodified GENE2 , while the polyubiquitylated forms were enriched only by GENE1 and not by GENE1 * , thus largely confirming our results with the linear ubiquitin-PCNA fusions .
In order to determine whether the observed interaction of GENE1 with ubiquitylated GENE2 was relevant in vivo , we performed ChIP assays on synchronized cultures to follow the chromatin association of GENE2 and GENE1 at replication forks stalled by HU treatment .
We therefore examined the effect of Mgs1 on the association between GENE1 and the polymerase delta subunits GENE2 , which is known to make direct contacts with GENE1 ( 38 ) .
Consistent with a competition between GENE1 and Mgs1 for GENE2 binding , overexpression of MGS1 or MGS1 * slightly reduced the signal corresponding to the Pol32-PCNA interaction .
GENE1 as an interactor of polyubiquitylated GENE2
Here we report a biophysical interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 .
Our data shows a physical interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 protein exogenously expressed in 293 T cells .

Thus both GENE1 and Siva-2 specifically interact with GENE2 .
GENE1 physically interacts with both GENE2 isoforms .
B. Co-immunoprecipitation ( Co-IP ) to evaluate GENE1 's interaction with GENE2 and Siva-2 in 293 T cells .
In this report we have shown that GENE1 and GENE2 physically interact .
Two GENE1 isoforms have been identified and both GENE1 isoforms interact with GENE2 .
Co-immunoprecipitation experiments verified previous observations that a deletion of the HR domain of GENE1 but not the NES abolishes interaction with GENE2 ( Figure 5D ) [ 20 ] .
Approximately 3 - 4 molecules of GENE1 bound each molecule of GENE2 , suggesting that several phosphorylated sites can bind GENE1 independently .
An isothermal calorimetry binding assay of fully phosphorylated GENE1 ( OTHER_GENE ) and GENE2 revealed a KD of 11 + - 2 muM , while the non-phosphorylated version showed no detectable binding ( Supplementary Fig. 1d ) .

We incubated purified GENE1 ( GST-Cdc14 ) , expressed in bacterial cells , with GENE2 extracted from yeast .
In the absence of GENE1 , GENE2 phosphorylation was detected on both S2 and S5 ( Fig. 2d ) .
To this end , we expressed and purified the human GENE1 homologue OTHER_GENE from bacterial cells and tested its phosphatase activity in vitro on human GENE2 purified from HEK293 T cells .
To this end , we expressed and purified the human GENE1 homologue GENE2 from bacterial cells and tested its phosphatase activity in vitro on human OTHER_GENE purified from HEK293 T cells .
To this end , we expressed and purified the human OTHER_GENE homologue GENE1 from bacterial cells and tested its phosphatase activity in vitro on human GENE2 purified from HEK293 T cells .
Incubation of GENE1 with purified GENE2 led to dissapearance of S2 and S5 phosphorylation ( Fig. 5c ) .
Together , our data are consistent with the idea that GENE1 and GENE2 form a stable heterodimer and that the critical role of the Pam18:Pam16 interaction is the physical tethering of GENE1 to the translocon via its interaction with GENE2 .
As expected ( D'silva et al. , 2008 ) , GENE1 and GENE2 were efficiently coprecipitated from wt and pam18Delta1 - 60 extracts but not from extracts derived from pam16L97W mitochondria ( Figure 4E ) .
The synthetic genetic interactions of mutations affecting the region of GENE1 immediately N-terminal to the J-like domain with the L150W and L97W alterations of GENE2 and GENE1 , respectively , raises the possibility that this region may play a role in the Pam16:Pam18 interaction .
( C ) Endogenous association of GENE1 with GENE2 .
GENE1 interacts with and ubiquitinates mitochondrial GENE2 .
( B ) Association of GENE1 with GENE2 in cell expression system .
To identify the sites of interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 , we examined whether a C terminus- ( amino acids257 - 278 ) deleted GENE1 mutant ( DeltaC GENE1 ) interacts with and ubiquitinate GENE2 .
Thus , a specific interaction between the C-terminal domain of GENE1 and a 20-aa domain of GENE2 is critical for the recognition and ubiquitination of GENE2 by GENE1 .
GENE1 was found to ubiquitinate endogenous GENE2 ( Fig. S3A ) and an in vitro ubiquitination assay suggested that GENE1 directly ubiquitinates GENE2 ( Fig. S3B ) .
Unexpectedly , an immunoprecipitation assay revealed that the interactions of these GENE1 mutants with GENE2 were not altered ( Fig. S4A ) , suggesting that increased ubiquitination of C257W is not because of an enhanced interaction of GENE2 with GENE1 .
We examined the effects of S-nitrosylation on the interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 .
We obtained similar data for the endogenous GENE1 client kinase GENE2 ( Fig. 3A ) .
However , in agreement with our yeast data , interaction of OTHER_GENE , GENE1 , and v-Src with the artificial linker mutants hHsp90-GSS63 and hHsp90-GSS95 was indistinguishable from GENE2 wild type ( Fig. 3 C and D ) .
However , in agreement with our yeast data , interaction of GENE1 , GENE2 , and v-Src with the artificial linker mutants hHsp90-GSS63 and hHsp90-GSS95 was indistinguishable from OTHER_GENE wild type ( Fig. 3 C and D ) .

As shown in Fig. 3A , immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag antibody detected GENE1 interaction with GENE2 wild type and with hHsp90-Sc-CL , but GENE1 interaction with hHsp90-Pf-CL was greatly reduced .
Although GENE1 wild-type , Hs-CL , GSS56 , and GSS95 proteins pulled down equivalent amounts of endogenous GENE2 , consistent with their equivalent in vivo activity , no GENE2 was detectable in pull-downs of yHsp90-Pf-CL .

GENE1 binds GENE2 protein in colon cancer
By immune precipitation assay , we identified a complex of GENE1 and GENE2 in cancer cells as well as polyp epithelial cells with high levels of GENE1 , but not in the polyp epithelium with low GENE1 levels ( Figure 3 ) .
A complex of GENE1 and GENE2 .
The ORC/Cdc6/MCM2 - GENE1 complex facilitates GENE2 - GENE1 dimerization during prereplicative complex formation
At first , ORC/Cdc6 recruits with the help of OTHER_GENE a single GENE1 - GENE2 hexamer to form an ' initial ' ORC/Cdc6/Cdt1/MCM2 - GENE2 complex .

At first , ORC/Cdc6 recruits with the help of GENE1 a single OTHER_GENE - GENE2 hexamer to form an ' initial ' ORC/Cdc6/Cdt1/MCM2 - GENE2 complex .
However , it remains unclear how the OCM is subsequently converted into a GENE1 - GENE2 double-hexamer .
Remarkably , only the OCM complex , but not the ' initial ' ORC/Cdc6/Cdt1/MCM2 - GENE1 complex , is competent for GENE2 - GENE1 dimerization .
The GENE1 - GENE2 dimer , in contrast to the GENE1 - GENE2 double-hexamer , interacts with ORC/Cdc6 and is salt-sensitive , classifying the arrested complex as a helicase-loading intermediate .
Through analysis of GENE1 - GENE2 hexamer-interface mutants we discovered a complex competent for GENE1 - GENE2 dimerization .
Furthermore , we observed that the GENE1 - GENE2 mutants assembled into an OCM complex in the presence of ATP .
In summary , our data demonstrate that ORC/Cdc6 facilitates directly GENE1 - GENE2 dimerization and show that productive GENE1 - GENE2 dimerization is essential for pre-RC formation .
Remarkably , the GENE1 - GENE2 interface mutants , once integrated into the OCM complex , were capable of GENE1 - GENE2 dimerization , but did not support salt stable double-hexamer formation .
In this study , we investigated the process of GENE1 - GENE2 hexamer dimerization .

It is clear from these experiments that all , but one , GENE1 - GENE2 double-hexamer interface mutant tested associated well with ORC/Cdc6 , and that the category 2 and 3 Ins mutants failed to form a salt-stable GENE1 - GENE2 complex onto DNA .
We analyzed two category 2 MCM mutants ( 4,5,7 Ins and 5,6,7 Ins ) ( Figure 3A ) and found that these formed complexes with ORC/Cdc6 similarly to wt GENE1 - GENE2 ( Figure 3A , lanes 5 - GENE2 ) .

In addition , we observed a large Ins GENE1 - GENE2 containing complex ( Figure 6F and G ; lower part ) , which appeared bigger than the GENE1 - GENE2 double-hexamer , suggesting that this complex contains an GENE1 - GENE2 dimer in complex with ORC/Cdc6 .
We observed a small Ins GENE1 - GENE2 containing complex ( Figure 6F and G ; upper part ) , which was similar to the pre-RC ATPgammaS complex .
Here we report that 2,5,6 Ins GENE1 - GENE2 can form an OCM complex in an ATP hydrolysis-dependent manner .
Remarkably , this 2,5,6 Ins GENE1 - GENE2 containing OCM complex is competent for the initial recruitment of a second GENE1 - GENE2 hexamer and thus promotes GENE1 - GENE2 dimerization .
Moreover , the GENE1 - GENE2 double-hexamer does not bind ORC/Cdc6 ( 15 ) , but we observed that the GENE1 - GENE2 dimer maintains association with ORC/Cdc6 , suggesting that successful GENE1 - GENE2 double-hexamer formation triggers another structural change in GENE1 - GENE2 , resulting in ORC/Cdc6 release .
Based on previous work ( 12 ) and this work , it is clear that ORC/Cdc6 maintains interaction with GENE1 - GENE2 after OCM formation .

Indeed , Myc-tagged GENE1 was able to immunoprecipitate Flag-tagged GENE2 in cell extracts ( Figure 1B , lanes 7 and 8) , consistent with previous results ( Breitkreutz et al. , 2010 ) .
Again , tagged versions of these GENE1 proteins were able to immunoprecipitate epitope-tagged GENE2 ( Figure 1C , lanes 5 and 11 ) .
( B ) Helicase loading with the indicated MSSB double mutant GENE1 - GENE2 complexes .
To define further the molecular defects of the mutant S. cerevisiae GENE1 - GENE2 complexes , we purified GENE1 - GENE2 complexes containing the lethal double mutants ( Mcm4D/6D , Mcm4D/7D and Mcm6D/7D ) along with the associated Cdt1 protein .
This treatment removes all of the helicase loading proteins ( ORC , Cdc6 and Cdt1 ) from the DNA but leaves loaded GENE1 - GENE2 complexes ( Figure 5B , top panel ) ( Randell et al. , 2006 ) .
To ensure that all of the GENE1 - GENE2 hexamers retained on the DNA were loaded , we washed the final DNA-associated proteins with high salt .
Cdt1 was not retained on the DNA under these conditions for mutant GENE1 - GENE2 complexes , indicating that the MSSB mutations did not interfere with the release of Cdt1 from the GENE1 - GENE2 complex during loading .

Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot demonstrated that endogenous GENE1 and GENE2 interact with each other in BxPC-3 cells ( Figure 1Bi ) ; the His-EGFR and Flag-CHIP that were both expressed after plasmid transfection in BxPC-3 cells can also interact with each other ( Figure 1Bii ) .

( F ) GENE1 suppresses GENE2 dimerization .
Taken together , GENE1 interacts with GENE2 and blocks the formation of the TRAF3-IKKepsilon complex , which subsequently impairs the phosphorylation of GENE2 and IRF3 and finally decreases IFN-beta production .
To achieve its negative regulatory function in cellular antiviral response , GENE1 associates with GENE2 and cooperates with OTUB1 to remove GENE2 poly-ubiquitin chain that is important for the recruitment of TBK1-IKKepsilon kinase complex .
Fas-associated factor ( GENE1 ) is a novel GENE2 interactor that regulates CD40-induced NF-kappaB activation via a negative feedback loop
GENE1 was able to interact with GENE2 both in vitro and in vivo .
The GENE1 N-terminal domain was sufficient to bind GENE2 and required the TRAF6-binding domain within the cytoplasmic tail of GENE2 for binding .
Knockdown of GENE1 prolonged CD40-induced NFkappaB , whereas overexpression of GENE1 suppressed CD40-induced NFkappaB activity and this required interaction of GENE1 with the GENE2 receptor via its FID domain .
Identification of GENE1 as a novel GENE2 interactor by YTH analysis
On sequencing , one clone was found to code a partial cDNA of GENE1 ( 50 - 602 aa ) and the other six clones were partial cDNAs of the GENE2 molecule .
To verify this putative interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 , EGY48 yeast cells harbouring the pEG202/LexA-CD40 ( bait ) or pEG202/LexA construct were grown in Glu/CM-H liquid medium , and LexA-CD40 fusion expression was then confirmed by immunoblotting analysis using a specific anti-LexA antibody ( Figure 1a ) .
An interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 proteins was confirmed as yeast cells were able to grow and form single colonies on the selective Gal-Raff/CM-H , W , L but not on the Glu/CM-H , W.L ( Figure 1b ) .
GENE1 interacts with the TRAF6-binding domain of GENE2 via its Fas-interacting domain
Both full-length GENE1 and OTHER_GENE co-immunopreciptated specifically with GENE2 , but not with the empty pcDNA3.1 vector control , indicating that the GENE1 N-terminal domain ( 1 - 305 aa ) is sufficient for CD40-FAF1 interaction ( Figure 2e ) .
Both full-length GENE1 and GENE2 co-immunopreciptated specifically with OTHER_GENE , but not with the empty pcDNA3.1 vector control , indicating that the GENE1 N-terminal domain ( 1 - 305 aa ) is sufficient for CD40-FAF1 interaction ( Figure 2e ) .

Endogenous interaction of GENE1 with GENE2 in CD40-expressing carcinoma cells was also demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation in EJ cells , confirming the physiological relevance of this interaction ( Figure 3 ) .
However , as we have shown here that GENE1 interacts with GENE2 and that this interaction requires the TRAF6-binding domain of GENE2 and the N-terminal FID domain of GENE1 , we postulated that GENE1 regulation of CD40-induced NFkappaB activation may be via an alternative mechanism requiring this interaction , perhaps through competition with TRAF6 for occupancy of this binding site on the GENE2 receptor .
As expected , co-transfection with GENE1 and HA-FAF1 resulted in co-immunoprecipitation of GENE2 with GENE1 ( Figure 7 , lane 5 ) .
However , the additional transfection of TRAF6 resulted in a significant reduction in GENE1 co-IP with GENE2 ( Figure 7 , lane 7 ) .
Although the interaction between GENE1 and members of the TRAF family is well characterised , this is the first study to show an interaction between GENE1 and Fas-associated factor 1 ( GENE2 ) .
Here we report for the first time the finding that GENE1 is also a novel interactor with the GENE2 receptor .
We further demonstrate that the CD40-FAF1interaction requires the TRAF6-binding domain in GENE1 and the FID of GENE2 , as GENE1 mutants lacking the TRAF6-binding domain failed to bind to GENE2 , although the N-terminal domain of GENE2 ( FAF1mt ; 1 - 305aa ) was sufficient to bind to GENE1 in the co-immunoprecipitation analysis .
In support of this , HA-tagged GENE1 fusions , including the full-length GENE1 ( FAF1wt ) and its N-terminal domain ( FAF1mt ; 1 - 305 aa ) , were co-immunoprecipitated and detected with GENE2 in the in vitro co-immunoprecipitation experiments .
( b ) GST pull-down of GENE1 by GENE2 protein was performed as previously described .
Here , we report the crystal structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae GENE1 snRNP core , containing most of GENE1 snRNA and all four RRM domains of the GENE2 protein .
To investigate the mechanism by which GENE1 chaperones recycling of GENE2 snRNA , we determined the 1.7 A-resolution crystal structure of the highly conserved central region of GENE2 RNA bound to 83 % of the 444-residue GENE1 protein , including all four RRMs .
Structure of GENE1 snRNA bound to GENE2
Mapping of the U6-A62G-suppressor mutations in both GENE1 ( ref . 27 ) and GENE2 reveals a striking correspondence between the suppressor sites and protein-RNA contacts , indicating that suppression is due to destabilization of the U6-Prp24 complex ( Fig. 5c , d ) .
The observed interactions of GENE1 nucleotides 39 - 44 with RRM3 of GENE2 and nucleotides 54 - 58 with RRM2 and oRRM4 are expected to be mutually exclusive with base pairing in the U2/U6 di-snRNA38 .
The stable interaction of GENE1 with GENE2 snRNA is at odds with its function as a U4/U6 annealing chaperone , since it must relinquish GENE2 to U4 snRNA , just as U4 must subsequently relinquish GENE2 to U2 snRNA .
We have determined the first crystal structure of GENE1 snRNA bound to the GENE2 protein , containing seventy nucleotides of GENE1 RNA and all four RRM domains of GENE2 .
Crystallization conditions for the purified GENE1 GENE2 complex were identified using a Mosquito high-throughput crystallization robot ( TTP LabTech ) .
GENE1 interactions with the GENE2 asymmetric bulge .
U6-A62G-suppressor mutations are expected to destabilize the interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 snRNA .
Co-immunoprecipitation was used to analyze interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 .
Interestingly , GENE1 interacted with GENE2 and catalyzed GENE2 ubiquitination , ultimately leading to GENE2 degradation .
Because GENE1 is an ubiquitin ligase that targets several oncoproteins for proteolysis and GENE2 is known to be subjected to ubiquitin modification by beta-TrCP [ 1,26 ] , we sought to determine whether GENE1 binds to GENE2 and leads to its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation .
To this end , the interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 was confirmed in HEK293 cells by reciprocal co-IP of HA-YAP and Flag-Fbxw7 ( Figure 5A ) .

Consistently , p53-MDM2 interaction was up- and down-regulated by GENE1 depletion and expression , respectively , whereas p53-XAF1 interaction was suppressed by GENE2 expression in a dose-associated manner ( Fig. 3 C-E and Fig. S4F ) .

However , OTHER_GENE was coprecipitated with GENE1 in p53+/+ but not in p53-/- cells , and DeltaZF5-XAF1 failed to interact with GENE1 in WTp53 cells , indicating that OTHER_GENE and GENE1 are brought to protein complex through association with a common partner GENE2 ( Fig. 4E and Fig. S5 F and G ) .

We found that GENE1 interacts with GENE2 through the ZF7 domain , and a ZF7-deleted mutant ( DeltaZF7-XAF1 ) has no activity to increase GENE2 stability and p21WAF1 ubiquitination ( Fig. 6 C and D and Fig. S7 E-H ) .

We mono-ubiquitinated GENE1 with N-terminally TAMRA-labelled GENE2 using UbcH5C S22R mutant34 and followed deubiquitination in gel assays ( Supplementary Fig. 3C ) .
Whereas GENE1 release by GENE2 FL is completed in < 1 min , GENE2 CD requires nearly 1 h for full dissociation ( Fig. 3a ) , confirming that the DUSP-Ubl domain activates GENE2 by promoting GENE1 release .
We show here that GENE1 can directly interact with the CREB-binding protein GENE2 family of transcriptional coactivators .
In addition , there is another interaction between the CREB-binding domain of GENE1 and the amino terminus of GENE2 .
Experiments described in this report have identified interaction between the carboxyl terminus of GENE1 and the E1A-binding domain of GENE2 .
The results showed that two regions of GENE1 bound GENE2 .
The CREB-binding region of GENE1 bound both OTHER_GENE and GENE2 ( Fig. 1C , lanes 4 , 5 , 7 , and 8) but did not bind Stat1tc , which lacks both the amino and carboxyl termini of OTHER_GENE ( Fig. 1C , lanes 6 and 9 ) .

The results showed that the CREB-binding domain of GENE1 could interact with both GENE2 and beta ( Fig. 2A , lanes 1 - 4 ) , confirming the results obtained with purified proteins ( Fig. 1C ) .
The E1A-binding domain of GENE1 only interacted with GENE2 ( Fig. 2B , lane 5 ) , not Stat1beta ( Fig. 2B , lane 2 ) , further confirming that the 38 residues at the carboxyl end is required for GENE2 to interact with the E1A-binding domain .

GENE1 and GENE2 form an abundant , heterodimeric complex in the cytoplasm that appears to have a function different from nuclear import of proteins with a classical NLS .
Identification of GENE1 as Copurifying with GENE2
The finding that GENE1 copurifies with GENE2 on an IBB column can be explained in two ways .
As seen from Fig. 1 B , GENE1 was recovered in the bound fraction only when GENE2 was added .
Thus , GENE1 binds to the IBB domain via GENE2 and is therefore an GENE2 binding protein .
Furthermore , the complex of GENE1 and GENE2 can be purified on an immobilized IBB domain from a HeLa cell extract in the same way as from an egg extract ( Fig. 1 C ) .
The RanBP7/importin-beta heterodimer can be formed by binding GENE1 from a Xenopus egg extract to z-tagged GENE2 ( Fig. 2 B ) .
First , GENE1 is now recovered in the RanBP7-bound fraction , confirming GENE2 as a RanGTP-binding protein .
GENE1 was expressed in E. coli and bound to GENE2 that was immobilized on IgG Sepharose via a z-tag .
When the elution was performed with RanGTP , z-importin-beta remained matrix bound , however GENE1 was dissociated from GENE2 and recovered in the eluate ( Fig. 2 C ) .

As seen from Fig. 5 A , a control lysate expressing importin-alpha which does not bind Ran , is negative , but the recombinantly expressed GENE1 protein gives a positive signal , just as GENE2 .
Thus , human GENE1 binds OTHER_GENE in a similar way as GENE2 .

To investigate further the potential association of GENE1 with GENE2 , and to identify any other proteins that may interact with the Vps35p/Vps29p complex , a series of cross-linking experiments was undertaken .
When cross-linker was added and either GENE1 ( lane 3 ) or GENE2 ( lane 4 ) was immunoprecipitated , a number of other proteins were detected .
GENE1 cross-linked to a protein with identical mobility to GENE2 , and both GENE1 and GENE2 cross-linked to three other proteins : p95 , p70 , and p50:based upon their respective migrations on the SDS polyacrylamide gel .
A faint band corresponding to GENE1 was also present in the GENE2 immunoprecipitates .
In the presence of cross-linker ( Fig. 2 B , lane 1 ) , GENE1 coimmunoprecipitates with GENE2 and the three other proteins : p95 , p70 , and p50 .
In lane 3 , antibodies against GENE1 immunoprecipitated both GENE1 and GENE2 , along with the three other proteins that coimmunoprecipitate with GENE2 ( compare lanes 1 and 3 ) .
GENE1 has been shown previously to be stably associated with GENE2 ( Horazdovsky et al. , 1997 ) , and hence this interaction was deemed to be a suitable positive control for cross-linking .
Therefore , to test directly the possibility that OTHER_GENE and GENE1 are interacting with Vps35p/Vps29p , P100 membranes were cross-linked as before , and GENE2 was immunoprecipitated from the resulting lysates .

Assembly of the Multimeric Complex Requires both GENE1 and GENE2
To address the question of which components of the complex are essential for forming the Vps35p/Vps29p/Vps26p/ Vps5p/Vps17p complex , lysates from various [35S]methionine-labeled yeast strains were treated with cross-linker , and either GENE1 or GENE2 was immunoprecipitated .
Interestingly , it appears that the interaction between GENE1 and OTHER_GENE is unaffected in either the OTHER_GENE or OTHER_GENE mutants ( Fig. 3 B , lanes 7 - 9 ) , and Vps35p/Vps29p can still interact with GENE2 .

GENE1 and GENE2 Colocalize on Sucrose Density Gradients
Furthermore , there is clear colocalization between GENE1 and GENE2 in the denser fractions ( fractions 8 and 9 ) .
The fractions in which GENE1 and GENE2 colocalize ( fractions 8 and 9 ) appear to be more dense than the fractions that contain Kex2p , and could correspond to a population of coated vesicles or tubules .
GENE1 and GENE2 are Present in Vesicle-enriched Membrane Fractions
As most vesicles also have a characteristic size in the range of 40 - 80 nm ( Schekman and Orci , 1996 ) , we have investigated the size of the membranes on which GENE1 and GENE2 are associated by gel filtration chromatography .
The bulk of GENE1 and GENE2 coeluted slightly later in fractions 66 - 72 .
These fractions also contained OTHER_GENE ( data not shown ) , indicating that GENE1 and GENE2 are present on membranes somewhat smaller than the membranes that contain the bulk of Vps10p ( i.e. , Golgi and endosomal membranes ) .
These fractions also contained GENE1 ( data not shown ) , indicating that OTHER_GENE and GENE2 are present on membranes somewhat smaller than the membranes that contain the bulk of Vps10p ( i.e. , Golgi and endosomal membranes ) .
These fractions also contained GENE1 ( data not shown ) , indicating that GENE2 and OTHER_GENE are present on membranes somewhat smaller than the membranes that contain the bulk of Vps10p ( i.e. , Golgi and endosomal membranes ) .
We observed that GENE1 coeluted with GENE2 ( Fig. 8) , suggesting that they remain associated .
Similarly , GENE1 coeluted with GENE2 , consistent with the data from the cross-linking experiments ( Figs. 2 and 3 B ) .
Thus , GENE1 and GENE2 associate with each other in the cytoplasm in a complex that is > 106 D.

Only overexpression of GENE1 was able to suppress the CPY sorting defect seen in cells carrying the GENE2 allele .
Cross-linking of both a crude lysate and the P100 membrane fraction demonstrated a direct interaction between GENE1 and GENE2 , and also revealed the presence of three other proteins in a complex with Vps35p/Vps29p .
These proteins were subsequently identified as GENE1 , OTHER_GENE , and GENE2 , and are all peripheral membrane proteins that are found in both the cytoplasm and on P100 membranes ( Table II ) .
These proteins were subsequently identified as GENE1 , GENE2 , and OTHER_GENE , and are all peripheral membrane proteins that are found in both the cytoplasm and on P100 membranes ( Table II ) .
These proteins were subsequently identified as OTHER_GENE , GENE1 , and GENE2 , and are all peripheral membrane proteins that are found in both the cytoplasm and on P100 membranes ( Table II ) .
As previous studies had reported that GENE1 and GENE2 form a stable complex with each other ( Horazdovsky et al. , 1997 ) , the two retromer subcomplexes would then comprise Vps35p/Vps29p/Vps26p and Vps5p/Vps17p .
When the solubilized proteins were subjected to gel filtration to size the individual components , it was observed that GENE1 remained associated with GENE2 in a complex with a predicted size of ~400 - 500 kD.
The data presented in this report are consistent with the complex containing OTHER_GENE , OTHER_GENE , GENE1 , OTHER_GENE , and GENE2 acting in formation of vesicles for endosome-to-Golgi retrieval , but do not exclude the possibility that other proteins also function in this pathway ( e.g. , Grd19p , Mvp1p , Vps30p , and Vps1p ) .

The bulk of GENE1 and GENE2 remain associated with each other and form a complex with a predicted size of 400 - 500 kD.
GENE1 remains associated with GENE2 in an ~230-kD complex .
We here purified an AF-6-interacting protein with a molecular mass of ~220 kD ( GENE1 ) to investigate the function of GENE2 at cell-cell adhesions .
GENE1 was partially colocalized with GENE2 and interacted with GENE2 in vivo and in vitro .
In this study , we found that GENE1 accumulated at cell- cell contacts , and that GENE2 interacted with GENE1 both in vivo and in vitro .
A protein with a molecular mass of ~220 kD ( GENE1 ) was detected in the glutathione eluate from the GST-AF-6 ( 1130 - 1612 aa ) affinity column , but not from the GST or GST-CD44 affinity columns ( Fig. 1 a ) , indicating that GENE1 specifically interacts with GENE2 ( 1130 - 1612 aa ) directly or indirectly .
Interaction of GENE1 and GENE2 In Vivo
When GENE1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-Fam antibody from confluent MDCKII cells , GENE2 was coimmunoprecipitated with GENE1 ( Fig. 4 a ) .
Similarly , GENE1 was also coimmunoprecipitated with GENE2 ( Fig. 4 b ) when GENE2 was immunoprecipitated with anti-AF-6 antibody from confluent MDCKII cells .
Interaction of GENE1 and GENE2 In Vitro
We examined which domain of GENE1 interacts with GENE2 using in vitro-translated GENE1 such as GENE1 ( 1 - 669 aa ) , GENE1 ( 670 - 1213 aa ) , GENE1 ( 1210 - 2100 aa ) , and GENE1 ( 2097 - 2554 aa ; Fig. 5 a ) .
These results indicate that mainly 1476 - 1918 aa of GENE1 is responsible for binding GENE1 to GENE2 .
Interaction of GENE1 and GENE2
We here identified GENE1 as an GENE2 ( 1130 - 1612 aa)-interacting protein .
The present results , however , showed that the GENE1 ( 1130 - 1612 aa ) containing the proline-rich region interacts with GENE2 , which has neither an SH3 nor a WW domain , and that the AF-6-interacting domain of GENE2 involves the cysteine and histidine domains characteristic of Ubps .
Here we showed that GENE1 interacts with GENE2 in vitro and in vivo .
